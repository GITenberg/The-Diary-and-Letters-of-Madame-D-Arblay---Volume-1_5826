      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay,&rdquo; edited by her niece, Mrs.
      Barrett, were originally published in seven volumes, during the years
      1842-1846. The work comprised but a portion of the diary and voluminous
      correspondence of its gifted writer, for the selection of which Madame
      D'Arblay, herself in part, and in part Mrs. Barrett, were responsible.
      From this selection the present one has been made, which, it is believed,
      will be found to include all the most valuable and interesting passages of
      the original. We can at least claim for this, the first popular edition of
      the Diary, that we have scrupulously fulfilled Madame D'Arblay's
      injunction to her former editor, &ldquo;that whatever might be effaced or
      omitted, nothing should in anywise be altered or added to her records.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the Diary itself it is hardly necessary here to say anything in praise.
      It has long been acknowledged a classic; it is indubitably the most
      entertaining, in some respects the most valuable, work of its kind in the
      English language, Regarded as a series of pictures of the society of the
      time, the Diary is unsurpassed for vivid Colouring and truthful
      delineation. As such alone it would possess a strong claim upon our
      attention, but how largely is our interest increased, when we find that
      the figures which fill the most prominent positions in the foreground of
      these pictures, are those of the most noble, most gifted, and Most
      distinguished men of the day! To mention but a few.

    <h2>
      MADAME D'ARBLAY, BY LORD MACAULAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frances Burney was descended from a family which bore the name of
      Macburney, and which, though probably of Irish origin, had been long
      settled in Shropshire and was possessed of considerable estates in that
      county. Unhappily, many years before her birth, the Macburneys began, as
      if of set purpose and in a spirit of determined rivalry, to expose and
      ruin themselves. The heir apparent, Mr. James Macburney offended his
      father by making a runaway match with an actress from Goodman's-fields&mdash;The
      old gentleman could devise no more judicious mode of wreaking vengeance on
      his undutiful boy than by marrying the cook. The cook gave birth to a son,
      named Joseph, who succeeded to all the lands of the family, while James
      was cut off with a shilling. The favourite son, however, was so
      extravagant that he soon became as poor as his disinherited brother. Both
      were forced to earn their bread by their labour. Joseph turned
      dancing-master and settled in Norfolk. James struck off the Mac from the
      beginning of his name and set up as a portrait painter at Chester. Here he
      had a son, named Charles, well known as the author of the &ldquo;History of
      Music&rdquo; and as the father of two remarkable children, of a son
      distinguished by learning and of a daughter still more honourably
      distinguished by genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles early showed a taste for that art of which, at a later period, he
      became the historian. He was apprenticed to a celebrated musician<a
      href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1">[1]</a> in
      London, and he applied himself to study with vigour and success. He early
      found a kind and munificent Patron in Fulk Greville, a highborn and
      highbred man, who seems to have had in large measure all the
      accomplishments and all the follies, all the virtues and all the vices,
      which, a hundred years ago, were considered as making up the character of
      a fine gentleman. Under such protection, the young artist had every
      prospect of a brilliant career in the capital. But his health failed. It
      became necessary for him to retreat from the smoke and river fog of London
      to the pure air of the coast. He accepted the place of organist at Lynn,
      and settled at that town with a young lady who had recently become his
      wife.<a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      At Lynn, in June, 1752, Frances Burney was born.<a href="#linknote-3"
       name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3">[3]</a> Nothing in her childhood
      indicated that she would, while still a young woman, have secured for
      herself an honourable and permanent place among English writers. She was
      shy and silent. Her brothers and sisters called her a dunce, and not
      altogether without some show of reason; for at eight years old she did not
      know her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1760, Mr. Burney quitted Lynn for London, and took a house in
      Poland-street; a situation which had been fashionable in the reign of
      Queen Anne, but which, since that time, had been deserted by most of its
      wealthy and noble inhabitants. He afterwards resided in St. Martin's Street,
      on the south side of Leicestersquare. His house there is still well known,
      and will continue to be well known as long as our island retains any trace
      of civilisation; for it was the dwelling of Newton, and the square turret
      which distinguishes it from all the surrounding buildings was Newton's
      observatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burney at once obtained as many pupils of the most respectable
      description as he had time to attend, and was thus enabled to support his
      family, modestly indeed, and frugally, but in comfort and independence.
      His professional merit obtained for him the degree of Doctor of Music from
      the University of Oxford;<a href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4"
       id="linknoteref-4">[4]</a> and his works on subjects connected with art
      gained for him a place, respectable, though certainly not eminent, among
      men of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of the mind of Frances Burney, from her ninth to her
      twenty-fifth year, well deserves to be recorded, When her education had
      proceeded no further than the hornbook, she lost her mother, and
      thenceforward she educated herself. Her father appears to have been as bad
      a father as a very honest, affectionate and sweet-tempered man can well
      be. He loved his daughter dearly; but it never seems to have occurred to
      him that a parent has other duties to perform to children than that of
      fondling them. It would indeed have been impossible for him to superintend
      their education himself. His professional engagements occupied him all
      day. At seven in the morning, he began to attend his pupils, and, when
      London was full, was sometimes employed in teaching till eleven at night.
      He was often forced to carry in his pocket a tin box of sandwiches and a
      bottle of wine and water, on which he dined in a hackney coach while
      hurrying from one scholar to another. Two of his daughters he sent to a
      seminary at Paris; but he imagined that Frances would run some risk of
      being perverted from the Protestant faith if she were educated in a
      Catholic country, and he therefore kept her at home. No governess, no
      teacher of any art or of any language was provided for her. But one of her
      sisters showed her how to write; and, before she was fourteen, she began
      to find pleasure in reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, however, by reading that her intellect was formed. Indeed,
      when her best novels were produced, her knowledge of books was very small.
      When at the height of her fame, she was unacquainted with the most
      celebrated works of Voltaire and Moliere; and, what seems still more
      extraordinary, had never heard or seen a line of Churchill, who, when she
      was a girl, was the most popular of living poets. It is particularly
      deserving of observation that she appears to have been by no means a novel
      reader. Her father's library was large, and he had admitted into it so
      many books which rigid moralists generally exclude that he felt uneasy, as
      he afterwards owned, when Johnson began to examine the shelves. But in the
      whole collection there was only a single novel, Fielding's &ldquo;Amelia."<a
      href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5">[5]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      An education, however, which to most girls would have been useless, but
      which suited Fanny's mind better than elaborate culture, was in constant
      progress during her passage from childhood to womanhood. The great book of
      human nature was turned over before her. Her father's social position was
      very peculiar. He belonged in fortune and station to the middle class. His
      daughters seemed to have been suffered to mix freely with those whom
      butlers and waiting-maids call vulgar. We are told that they were in the
      habit of playing with the children of a wigmaker who lived in the
      adjoining house. Yet few nobles could assemble in the most stately
      mansions of Grosvenor-square or St. James's Square a society so various
      and so brilliant as was sometimes to be found in Dr. Burney's cabin. His
      mind, though not very powerful or capacious, was restlessly active; and,
      in the intervals of his professional pursuits, he had contrived to lay up
      much miscellaneous information. His attainments, the suavity of his temper
      and the general simplicity of his manners had obtained for him ready
      admission to the first literary circles. While he was still at Lynn, he
      had won Johnson's heart by sounding with honest zeal the praises of the
      &ldquo;English Dictionary.&rdquo; In London, the two friends met frequently and agreed
      most harmoniously. One tie, indeed, was wanting to their mutual
      attachment. Burney loved his own art passionately, and Johnson just knew
      the bell of St. Clement's church from the organ. They had, however, many
      topics in common; and on winter nights their conversations were sometimes
      prolonged till the fire had gone out and the candles had burned away to
      the wicks. Burney's admiration of the powers which had produced &ldquo;Rasselas&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;The Rambler&rdquo; bordered on idolatry. He gave a singular proof of this
      at his first visit to Johnson's ill-furnished garret. The master of the
      apartment was not at home. The enthusiastic visitor looked about for some
      relic which he could carry away, but he could see nothing lighter than the
      chairs and the fireirons. At last he discovered an old broom, tore some
      bristles from the stump, wrapped them in silver paper, and departed as
      happy as Louis IX. when the holy nail of St. Denis was found.<a
      href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6">[6]</a>
      Johnson, on the other hand, condescended to growl out that Burney was an
      honest fellow, a man whom it was impossible not to like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garrick, too, was a frequent visitor in Poland-street and St.
      Martin's-street. That wonderful actor loved the society of children,
      partly from good nature and partly from vanity. The ecstasies of mirth and
      terror, which his gestures and play of countenance never failed to produce
      in a nursery, flattered him quite as much as the applause of mature
      critics. He often exhibited all his powers of mimicry for the amusement of
      the little Burneys, awed them by shuddering and crouching as if he saw a
      ghost, scared them by raving like a maniac in St. Luke's, and then at once
      became an auctioneer, a chimney-sweeper or an old woman, and made them
      laugh till the tears ran down their cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it would be tedious to recount the names of all the men of letters and
      artists whom Frances Burney had an opportunity of seeing and hearing.
      Colman, Twining, Harris, Baretti, Hawkesworth, Reynolds, Barry, were among
      those who occasionally surrounded the tea table and supper tray at her
      father's modest dwelling. This was not all. The distinction which Dr.
      Burney had acquired as a musician and as the historian of music, attracted
      to his house the most eminent musical performers of that age. The greatest
      Italian singers who visited England regarded him as the dispenser of fame
      in their art, and exerted themselves to obtain his suffrage. Pacchierotti
      became his intimate friend. The rapacious Agujari, who sang for nobody
      else under fifty pounds an air, sang her best for Dr. Burney without a
      fee; and in the company of Dr. Burney even the haughty and eccentric
      Gabrielli constrained herself to behave with civility. It was thus in his
      power to give, with scarcely any expense, concerts equal to those of the
      aristocracy. On such occasions, the quiet street in which he lived was
      blocked up by coroneted chariots, and his little drawing-room was crowded
      with peers, peeresses, ministers and ambassadors. On one evening, of which
      we happen to have a full account, there were present Lord Mulgrave, Lord
      Bruce, Lord and Lady Edgecumbe, Lord Barrington from the War office, Lord
      Sandwich from the Admiralty, Lord Ashburnham, with his gold key dangling
      from his pocket, and the French ambassador, M. De Guignes, renowned for
      his fine person and for his success in gallantry. But the great show of
      the night was the Russian ambassador, Count Orloff, whose gigantic figure
      was all in a blaze with jewels, and in whose demeanour the untamed
      ferocity of the Scythian might be discerned through a thin varnish of
      French Politeness. As he stalked about the small parlour, brushing the
      ceiling with his toupee, the girls whispered to each other, with mingled
      admiration and horror, that he was the favoured lover of his august
      mistress; that he had borne the chief part in the revolution to which she
      owed her throne; and that his huge hands, now glittering with diamond
      rings, had given the last squeeze to the windpipe of her unfortunate
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such illustrious guests as these were mingled all the most remarkable
      specimens of the race of lions, a kind of game which is hunted in London
      every spring with more than Meltonian ardour and perseverance. Bruce, who
      had washed down steaks cut from living oxen with water from the fountains
      of the Nile, came to swagger and talk about his travels. Ornai lisped
      broken English, and made all the assembled musicians hold their ears by
      howling Otaheitean love-songs, such as those with which Oberea charmed her
      Opano.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the literary and fashionable society which occasionally met under Dr.
      Burney's roof, Frances can scarcely be said to have mingled.<a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7">[7]</a> She was
      not a musician, and could therefore bear no part in the concerts. She was
      shy almost to awkwardness, and she scarcely ever joined in the
      conversation. The slightest remark from a stranger disconcerted her, and
      even the old friends of her father who tried to draw her out could seldom
      extract more than a Yes or a No. Her figure was small, her face not
      distinguished by beauty. She was therefore suffered to withdraw quietly to
      the background, and, unobserved herself, to observe all that passed. Her
      nearest relations were aware that she had good sense, but seem not to have
      suspected that under her demure and bashful deportment were concealed a
      fertile invention and a keen sense of the ridiculous. She had not, it is
      true, an eye for the fine shades of character. But every marked
      peculiarity instantly caught her notice and remained engraven on her
      imagination. Thus while still a girl she had laid up such a store of
      materials for fiction as few of those who mix much in the world are able
      to accumulate during a long life. She had watched and listened to people
      of every class, from princes and great officers of state down to artists
      living in garrets and poets familiar with subterranean cookshops. Hundreds
      of remarkable persons had passed in review before her, English, French,
      German, Italian, lords and fiddlers, deans of cathedrals and managers of
      theatres, travellers leading about newly caught savages, and singing women
      escorted by deputy husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strong was the impression made on the mind of Frances by the society
      which she was in the habit of seeing and hearing, that she began to write
      little fictitious narratives as soon as she could use her pen with ease,
      which, as we have said, was not very early. Her sisters were amused by her
      stories. But Dr. Burney knew nothing of their existence; and in another
      quarter her literary propensities met with serious discouragement. When
      she was fifteen, her father took a second wife.<a href="#linknote-8"
       name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8">[8]</a> The new Mrs. Burney soon
      found out that her daughter-in-law was fond of scribbling, and delivered
      several good-natured lectures on the subject. The advice no doubt was well
      meant, and might have been given by the most judicious friend; for at that
      time, from causes to which we may hereafter advert, nothing could be more
      disadvantageous to a young lady than to be known as a novel writer.
      Frances yielded, relinquished her favourite pursuit, and made a bonfire of
      all her manuscripts.<a href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9"
       id="linknoteref-9">[9]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      She now hemmed and stitched from breakfast to dinner with scrupulous
      regularity. But the dinners of that time were early; and the afternoon was
      her own. Though she had given up novel-writing, she was still fond of
      using her pen. She began to keep a diary, and she corresponded largely
      with a person who seems to have had the chief share in the formation of
      her mind. This was Samuel Crisp, an old friend of her father. His name,
      well known, near a century ago, in the most splendid circles of London,
      has long been forgotten. His history is, however, so interesting and
      instructive, that it tempts us to venture on a digression. Long before
      Frances Burney was born, Mr. Crisp had made his entrance into the world,
      with every advantage. He was well connected and well educated. His face
      and figure were conspicuously handsome; his manners were polished; his
      fortune was easy; his character was without stain; he lived in the best
      society; he had read much; he talked well; his taste in literature, music,
      painting, architecture, sculpture, was held in high esteem. Nothing that
      the world can give seemed to be wanting to his happiness and
      respectability, except that he should understand the limits of his powers,
      and should not throw away distinctions which were within his reach in the
      pursuit of distinctions which were unattainable. &ldquo;It is an uncontrolled
      truth,&rdquo; says Swift, &ldquo;that no man ever made an ill figure who understood
      his own talents, nor a good one who mistook them.&rdquo; Every day brings with
      it fresh illustrations of this weighty saying; but the best commentary
      that we remember is the history of Samuel Crisp. Men like him have their
      proper place, and it is a most important one, in the Commonwealth of
      Letters. It is by the judgment of such men that the rank of authors is
      finally determined. It is neither to the multitude, nor to the few who are
      gifted with great creative genius, that we are to look for sound critical
      decisions. The multitude, unacquainted with the best models, are
      captivated by whatever stuns and dazzles them. They deserted Mrs. Siddons
      to run after Master Betty; and they now prefer, we have no doubt, Jack
      Sheppard to Van Artevelde. A man of great original genius, on the other
      hand, a man who has attained to mastery in some high walk of art, is by no
      means to be implicitly trusted as a judge of the performances of others.
      The erroneous decisions pronounced by such men are without number. It is
      commonly supposed that jealousy makes them unjust. But a more creditable
      explanation may easily be found. The very excellence of a work shows that
      some of the faculties of the author have been developed at the expense of
      the rest&mdash;-for it is not given to the human intellect to expand
      itself widely in all directions at once and to be at the same time
      gigantic and well-proportioned. Whoever becomes pre-eminent in any art,
      nay, in any style of art, generally does so by devoting himself with
      intense and exclusive enthusiasm to the pursuit of one kind of excellence.
      His perception of other kinds of excellence is too often impaired. Out of
      his own department, he blames at random, and is far less to be trusted
      than the mere connoisseur, who produces nothing, and whose business is
      only to judge and enjoy. One painter is distinguished by his exquisite
      finishing. He toils day after day to bring the veins of a cabbage leaf,
      the folds of a lace veil, the wrinkles of an old woman's face, nearer and
      nearer to perfection. In the time which he employs on a square foot of
      canvas, a master of a different order covers the walls of a palace with
      gods burying giants under mountains, or makes the cupola of a church alive
      with seraphim and martyrs. The more fervent the passion of each of these
      artists for his art, the higher the merit of each in his own line, the
      more unlikely it is that they will justly appreciate each other. Many
      persons, who never handled a pencil, probably do far more justice to
      Michael Angelo than would have been done by Gerard Douw, and far more
      justice to Gerard Douw than would have been done by Michael Angelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the same with literature. Thousands, who have no spark of the genius
      of Dryden or Wordsworth, do to Dryden the justice which has never been
      done by Wordsworth, and to Wordsworth the justice which, we suspect, would
      never have been done by Dryden. Gray, Johnson, Richardson, Fielding, are
      all highly esteemed by the great body of intelligent and well informed
      men. But Gray could see no merit in &ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; and Johnson could see no
      merit in &ldquo;The Bard.&rdquo; Fielding thought Richardson a solemn prig, and
      Richardson perpetually expressed contempt and disgust for Fielding's
      lowness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crisp seems, as far as we can judge, to have been a man eminently
      qualified for the useful office of a connoisseur. His talents and
      knowledge fitted him to appreciate justly almost every species of
      intellectual superiority. As an adviser he was inestimable. Nay, he might
      probably have held a respectable rank as a writer if he would have
      confined himself to some department of literature in which nothing more
      than sense, taste, and reading was required. Unhappily, he set his heart
      on being a great poet, wrote a tragedy in five acts on the death of
      Virginia, and offered it to Garrick, who was his personal friend. Garrick
      read, shook his head, and expressed a doubt whether it would be wise in
      Mr. Crisp to stake a reputation, which stood high, on the success of such
      a piece. But the author, blinded by self-love, set in motion a machinery
      such as none could long resist. His intercessors were the most eloquent
      man and the most lovely woman of that generation. Pitt was induced to read
      &ldquo;Virginia&rdquo; and to pronounce it excellent. Lady Coventry, with fingers
      which might have furnished a model to sculptors, forced the manuscript
      into the reluctant hand of the manager; and, in the year 1754, the play
      was brought forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing that skill or friendship could do was omitted. Garrick wrote both
      prologue and epilogue. The zealous friends of the author filled every box;
      and, by their strenuous exertions, the life of the play was prolonged
      during ten nights. But though there was no clamorous reprobation, it was
      universally felt that the attempt had failed. When &ldquo;Virginia&rdquo; was printed,
      the public disappointment was even greater than at the representation. The
      critics, the Monthly Reviewers in particular, fell on plot, characters,
      and diction without mercy, but, we fear, not without justice. We have
      never met with a copy of the play; but if we may judge from the lines
      which are extracted in the &ldquo;Gentleman's Magazine,&rdquo; and which do not appear
      to have been malevolently selected, we should say that nothing but the
      acting of Garrick and the partiality of the audience could have saved so
      feeble and unnatural a drama from instant damnation. The ambition of the
      poet was still unsubdued. When the London season closed, he applied
      himself vigorously to the work of removing blemishes. He does not seem to
      have suspected, what we are strongly inclined to suspect, that the whole
      piece was one blemish, and that the passages which were meant to be fine
      were, in truth, bursts of that tame extravagance into which writers fall
      when they set themselves to be sublime and pathetic in spite of nature. He
      omitted, added, retouched, and flattered himself with hopes of a complete
      success in the following year; but, in the following year, Garrick showed
      no disposition to bring the amended tragedy on the stage. Solicitation and
      remonstrance were tried in vain. Lady Coventry, drooping under that malady
      which seems ever to select what is loveliest for its prey, could render no
      assistance. The manager's language was civilly evasive; but his resolution
      was inflexible. Crisp had committed a great error; but he had escaped with
      a very slight penance. His play had not been hooted from the boards. It
      had, on the contrary, been better received than many very estimable
      performances have been--than Johnson's &ldquo;Irene,&rdquo; for example, or Goldsmith's
      &ldquo;Good-natured Man.&rdquo; Had Crisp been wise, he would have thought himself
      happy in having purchased self-knowledge so cheap. He would have
      relinquished, without vain repinings, the hope of poetical distinction,
      and would have turned to the many sources of happiness which he still
      possessed. Had he been, on the other hand, an unfeeling and unblushing
      dunce, he would have gone on writing scores of bad tragedies in defiance
      of censure and derision. But he had too much sense to risk a second
      defeat, yet too little to bear his first defeat like a man. The fatal
      delusion that he was a great dramatist had taken firm possession of his
      mind. His failure he attributed to every cause except the true one. He
      complained of the ill-will of Garrick, who appears to have done everything
      that ability and zeal could do, and who, from selfish motives, would, of
      course, have been well pleased if &ldquo;Virginia&rdquo; had been as successful as
      &ldquo;The Beggar's Opera.&rdquo; Nay, Crisp complained of the languor of the friends
      whose partiality had given him three benefit nights to which he had no
      claim. He complained of the injustice of the spectators, when, in truth,
      he ought to have been grateful for their unexampled patience. He lost his
      temper and spirits, and became a cynic and a hater of mankind. From London
      be retired to Hampton, and from Hampton to a solitary and long-deserted
      mansion, built on a common in one of the wildest tracts of Surrey.<a
      href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10">[10]</a> No
      road, not even a sheepwalk, connected his lonely dwelling with the abodes
      of men. The place of his retreat was strictly concealed from his old
      associates. In the spring, he sometimes emerged, and was seen at
      exhibitions and concerts in London. But he soon disappeared and hid
      himself, with no society but his books, in his dreary hermitage. He
      survived his failure about thirty years. A new generation sprang up around
      him. No memory of his bad verses remained among men. His very name was
      forgotten. How completely the world had lost sight of him will appear from
      a single circumstance. We looked for his name in a copious Dictionary of
      Dramatic Authors published while he was still alive, and we found only
      that Mr. Samuel Crisp, of the Custom-house, had written a play called
      &ldquo;Virginia,&rdquo; acted in 1754. To the last, however, the unhappy man continued
      to brood over the injustice of the manager and the pit, and tried to
      convince himself and others that he had missed the highest literary
      honours only because he had omitted some fine passages in compliance with
      Garrick's judgment. Alas for human nature, that the wounds of vanity
      should smart and bleed so much longer than the wounds of affection! Few
      people, we believe, whose nearest friends and relations died in 1754, had
      any acute feeling of the loss in 1782. Dear sisters, and favourite
      daughters, and brides snatched away before the honeymoon was passed, had
      been forgotten, or were remembered only with a tranquil regret. But Samuel
      Crisp was still mourning for his tragedy, like Rachel weeping for her
      children, and would not be comforted. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; such was his language
      twenty-eight years after his disaster, &ldquo;never give up or alter a tittle
      unless it perfectly coincides with your inward feelings. I can say this to
      my sorrow and my cost. But mum!&rdquo; Soon after these words were written, his
      life&mdash;a life which might have been eminently useful and happy&mdash;ended
      in the same gloom in which, during more than a quarter of a century, it
      had been passed. We have thought it worth while to rescue from oblivion
      this curious fragment of literary history. It seems to us at once
      ludicrous, melancholy, and full of instruction.<a href="#linknote-11"
       name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11">[11]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Crisp was an old and very intimate friend of the Burneys. To them alone
      was confided the name of the desolate old hall in which he hid himself
      like a wild beast in a den. For them were reserved such remains of his
      humanity as had survived the failure of his play. Frances Burney he
      regarded as his daughter. He called her his Fannikin; and she in return
      called him her dear Daddy. In truth, he seems to have done much more than
      her real father for the development of her intellect; for though he was a
      bad poet, he was a scholar, a thinker, and an excellent counsellor. He was
      particularly fond of Dr. Burney's concerts. They had indeed, been
      commenced at his suggestion, and when he visited London he constantly
      attended them. But when he grew old, and when gout, brought on partly by
      mental irritation, confined him to his retreat, he was desirous of having
      a glimpse of that gay and brilliant world from which he was exiled, and he
      pressed Fannikin to send him full accounts of her father's evening
      parties. A few of her letters to him have been published; and it is
      impossible to read them without discerning in them all the powers which
      afterwards produced &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo;; the quickness in catching
      every odd peculiarity of character and manner; the skill in grouping; the
      humour, often richly comic, sometimes even farcical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny's propensity to novel-writing had for a time been kept down. It now
      rose up stronger than ever. The heroes and heroines of the tales which had
      perished in the flames were still present to the eye of her mind. One
      favourite story, in particular, haunted her imagination. It was about a
      certain Caroline Evelyn, a beautiful damsel who made an unfortunate love
      match and died, leaving an infant daughter. Frances began to image to
      herself the various scenes, tragic and comic, through which the poor
      motherless girl, highly connected on one side, meanly connected on the
      other, might have to pass. A crowd of unreal beings, good and bad, grave
      and ludicrous, surrounded the pretty, timid young orphan; a coarse sea
      captain; an ugly, insolent fop, blazing in a superb court dress; another
      fop, as ugly and as insolent, but lodged on Snow-hill and tricked out in
      second-hand finery for the Hampstead ball; an old woman, wrinkles and
      rouge, flirting her fan with the air of a miss of seventeen and screaming
      in a dialect made up of vulgar French and vulgar English; a poet, lean and
      ragged, with a broad Scotch accent. By degrees these shadows acquired
      stronger and stronger consistence; the impulse which urged Frances to
      write became irresistible; and the result was the &ldquo;History of Evelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came, naturally enough, a wish, mingled with many fears, to appear
      before the public; for, timid as Frances was, and bashful, and altogether
      unaccustomed to hear her own praises, it is clear that she wanted neither
      a strong passion for distinction, nor a just confidence in her own powers.
      Her scheme was to become, if possible, a candidate for fame without
      running any risk of disgrace. She had not money to bear the expense of
      printing. It was therefore necessary that some bookseller should be
      induced to take the risk; and such a bookseller was not readily found.
      Dodsley refused even to look at the manuscript unless he were intrusted
      with the name of the author. A publisher in Fleet-street, named Lowndes,
      was more complaisant. Some correspondence took place between this person
      and Miss Burney, who took the name of Grafton, and desired that the
      letters addressed to her might be left at the Orange Coffee-house. But,
      before the bargain was finally struck, Fanny thought it her duty to obtain
      her father's consent. She told him that she had written a book, that she
      wished to have his permission to publish it anonymously, but that she
      hoped that he would not insist upon seeing it. What followed may serve to
      illustrate what we meant when we said that Dr. Burney was as bad a father
      as so goodhearted a man could possibly be. It never seems to have crossed
      his mind that Fanny was about to take a step on which the whole happiness
      of her life might depend, a step which might raise her to an honourable
      eminence or cover her with ridicule and contempt. Several people had
      already been trusted, and strict concealment was therefore not to be
      expected. On so grave an occasion, it was surely his duty to give his best
      counsel to his daughter, to win her confidence, to prevent her from
      exposing herself if her book were a bad one, and, if it were a good one,
      to see that the terms which she made with the publisher were likely to be
      beneficial to her. Instead of this, he only stared, burst out a-laughing,
      kissed her, gave her leave to do as she liked, and never even asked the
      name of her work. The contract with Lowndes was speedily concluded. Twenty
      pounds were given for the copyright, and were accepted by Fanny with
      delight. Her father's inexcusable neglect of his duty happily caused her
      no worse evil than the loss of twelve or fifteen hundred pounds.<a
      href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12">[12]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After many delays, &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; appeared in January, 1778.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Fanny was sick with terror, and durst hardly stir out of doors. Some
      days passed before anything was heard of the book. It had, indeed, nothing
      but its own merits to push it into public favour. Its author was unknown.
      The house by which it was published, was not, we believe, held high in
      estimation. No body of partisans had been engaged to applaud. The better
      class of readers expected little from a novel about a young lady's
      entrance into the world. There was, indeed, at that time a disposition
      among the most respectable people to condemn novels generally: nor was
      this disposition by any means without excuse; for works of that sort were
      then almost always silly and very frequently wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, however, the first faint accents of praise began to be heard: The
      keepers of the circulating libraries reported that everybody was asking
      for &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; and that some person had guessed Anstey<a
      href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13" id="linknoteref-13">[13]</a> to
      be the author. Then came a favourable notice in the &ldquo;London Review&rdquo;; then
      another still more favourable in the &ldquo;Monthly.&rdquo; And now the book found its
      way to tables which had seldom been polluted by marble-covered volumes.
      Scholars and statesmen, who contemptuously abandoned the crowd of romances
      to Miss Lydia Languish and Miss Sukey Saunter, were not ashamed to own
      that they could not tear themselves away from &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo; Fine carriages
      and rich liveries, not often seen east of Temple-bar, were attracted to
      the publisher's shop in Fleet-street. Lowndes was daily questioned about
      the author, but was himself as much in the dark as any of the questioners.
      The mystery, however, could not remain a mystery long. It was known to
      brothers and sisters, aunts and cousins: and they were far too proud and
      too happy to be discreet. Dr. Burney wept over the book in rapture. Daddy
      Crisp shook his fist at his Fannikin in affectionate anger at not having
      been admitted to her confidence. The truth was whispered to Mrs. Thrale:
      and then it began to spread fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book had been admired while it had been ascribed to men of letters
      long conversant with the world and accustomed to composition. But when it
      was known that a reserved, silent young woman had produced the best work
      of fiction that had appeared since the death of Smollett, the
      acclamations were redoubled. What she had done was, indeed, extraordinary.
      But, as usual, various reports improved the story till it became
      miraculous. &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; it was said, was the work of a girl of seventeen.
      Incredible as this tale was, it continued to be repeated down to our own
      time. Frances was too honest to confirm it. Probably she was too much a
      woman to contradict it; and it was long before any of her detractors
      thought of this mode of annoyance. Yet there was no want of low minds and
      bad hearts in the generation which witnessed her first appearance. There
      was the envious Kenrick and the savage Wolcot, the asp George Stevens and
      the polecat John Williams. It did not, however, occur to them to search
      the parish register of Lynn, in order that they might be able to twit a
      lady with having concealed her age. That truly chivalrous exploit was
      reserved for a bad writer<a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14"
       id="linknoteref-14">[14]</a> of our own time, whose spite she had provoked
      by not furnishing him with materials for a worthless edition of Boswell's
      &ldquo;Life of Johnson,&rdquo; some sheets of which our readers have doubtless seen
      round parcels of better books.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must return to our story. The triumph was complete. The timid and
      obscure girl found herself on the highest pinnacle of fame. Great men, on
      whom she had gazed at a distance with humble reverence, addressed her with
      admiration, tempered by the tenderness due to her sex and age. Burke,
      Windham, Gibbon, Reynolds, Sheridan, were among her most ardent eulogists.
      Cumberland<a href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15" id="linknoteref-15">[15]</a>
      acknowledged her merit, after his fashion, by biting his lips and
      wriggling in his chair whenever her name was mentioned. But it was at
      Streatham that she tasted, in the highest perfection, the sweets of
      flattery mingled with the sweets of friendship. Mrs. Thrale, then at the
      height of prosperity and popularity&mdash;with gay spirits, quick wit,
      showy, though superficial, acquirements, pleasing, though not refined,
      manners, a singularly amiable temper and a loving heart-felt towards Fanny
      as towards a younger sister. With the Thrales, Johnson was domesticated.
      He was an old friend of Dr. Burney; but he had probably taken little
      notice of Dr. Burney's daughters; and Fanny, we imagine, had never in her
      life dared to speak to him, unless to ask whether he wanted a nineteenth
      or a twentieth cup of tea. He was charmed by her tale, and preferred it to
      the novels of Fielding, to whom, indeed, he had always been grossly
      unjust. He did not, indeed, carry his partiality so far as to place
      &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; by the side of &ldquo;Clarissa&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sir Charles Grandison&rdquo;; yet he
      said that his little favourite had done enough to have made even
      Richardson feel uneasy. With Johnson's cordial approbation of the book was
      mingled a fondness, half gallant, half paternal, for the writer; and this
      fondness his age and character entitled him to show without restraint. He
      began by putting her hand to his lips. But he soon clasped her in his huge
      arms, and immediately implored her to be a good girl. She was his pet, his
      dear love, his dear little Burney, his little character-monger. At one
      time, he broke forth in praise of the good taste of her caps. At another
      time, he insisted on teaching her Latin. That, with all his coarseness and
      irritability, he was a man of sterling benevolence, has long been
      acknowledged. But how gentle and endearing his deportment could be, was
      not known till the recollections of Madame D'Arblay were published.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have mentioned a few of the most eminent of those who paid their homage
      to the author of &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo; The crowd of inferior admirers would require a
      catalogue as long as that in the second book of the &ldquo;Iliad.&rdquo; In that
      catalogue would be Mrs. Cholmondeley, the sayer of odd things; and Seward,
      much given to yawning; and Baretti, who slew the man in the Haymarket; and
      Paoli, talking broken English; and Langton, taller by the head than any
      other member of the club; and Lady Millar, who kept a vase wherein fools
      were wont to put bad verses; and Jerningham, who wrote verses fit to be
      put into the vase of Lady Millar; and Dr. Franklin&mdash;not, as some have
      dreamed, the great Pennsylvanian Dr. Franklin, who could not then have
      paid his respects to Miss Burney without much risk of being hanged, drawn,
      and quartered, but Dr. Franklin the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not have been surprising if such success had turned even a strong
      head and corrupted even a generous and affectionate nature. But in the
      &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; we can find no trace of any feeling inconsistent with a truly
      modest and amiable disposition. There is, indeed, abundant proof that
      Frances enjoyed with an intense, though a troubled, joy, the honours which
      her genius had won; but it is equally clear that her happiness sprang from
      the happiness of her father, her sister, and her dear Daddy Crisp. While
      flattered by the great, the opulent and the learned, while followed along
      the Steyne at Brighton and the Pantiles at Tunbridge Wells by the gaze of
      admiring crowds, her heart seems to have been still with the little
      domestic circle in St. Martin's Street. If she recorded with minute
      diligence all the compliments, delicate and coarse, which she heard
      wherever she turned, she recorded them for the eyes of two or three
      persons who had loved her from infancy, who had loved her in obscurity,
      and to whom her fame gave the purest and most exquisite delight. Nothing
      can be more unjust than to confound these outpourings of a kind heart,
      sure of perfect sympathy, with the egotism of a bluestocking who prates to
      all who come near her about her own novel or her own volume of sonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural that the triumphant issue of Miss Burney's first venture
      should tempt her to try a second. &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; though it had raised her
      fame, had added nothing to her fortune. Some of her friends urged her to
      write for the stage. Johnson promised to give her his advice as to the
      composition. Murphy, who was supposed to understand the temper of the pit
      as well as any man of his time, undertook to instruct her as to stage
      effect. Sheridan declared that he would accept a play from her without
      even reading it. Thus encouraged, she wrote a comedy named &ldquo;The Witlings.&rdquo;
       Fortunately, it was never acted or printed. We can, we think, easily
      perceive, from the little which is said on the subject in the &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo;
       that &ldquo;The Witlings&rdquo; would have been damned, and that Murphy and Sheridan
      thought so, though they were too polite to say so. Happily Frances had a
      friend who was not afraid to give her pain. Crisp, wiser for her than he
      had been for himself, read the manuscript in his lonely retreat and
      manfully told her that she had failed, and that to remove blemishes here
      and there would be useless; that the piece had abundance of wit but no
      interest, that it was bad as a whole; that it would remind every reader of
      the &ldquo;Femmes Savantes,&rdquo; which, strange to say, she had never read, and that
      she could not sustain so close a comparison with Moliere. This opinion, in
      which Dr. Burney concurred, was sent to Frances in what she called &ldquo;a
      hissing, groaning, catcalling epistle.&rdquo; But she had too much sense not to
      know that it was better to be hissed and catcalled by her Daddy than by a
      whole sea of heads in the pit of Drury-lane theatre; and she had too good
      a heart not to be grateful for so rare an act of friendship. She returned
      an answer which shows how well she deserved to have a judicious, faithful,
      and affectionate adviser. &ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;to console myself for
      your censure by this greatest proof I have received of the sincerity,
      candour, and, let me add, esteem of my dear daddy. And, as I happen to
      love myself more than my play, this consolation is not a very trifling
      one. This, however, seriously I do believe, that when my two daddies put
      their heads together to concert that hissing, groaning, catcalling epistle
      they sent me, they felt as sorry for poor little Miss Bayes as she could
      possibly do for herself. You see I do not attempt to repay your frankness
      with an air of pretended carelessness. But, though somewhat disconcerted
      just now, I will promise not to let my vexation live out another day.
      Adieu, my dear daddy; I won't be mortified and I won't be downed; but I
      will be proud to find I have, out of my own family, as well as in it, a
      friend who loves me well enough to speak plain truth to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances now turned from her dramatic schemes to an undertaking far better
      suited to her talents. She determined to write a new tale on a plan
      excellently contrived for the display of the powers in which her
      superiority to other writers lay. It was, in truth, a grand and various
      picture gallery, which presented to the eye a long series of men and
      women, each marked by some strong peculiar feature. There were avarice and
      prodigality, the pride of blood and the pride of money, morbid
      restlessness and morbid apathy, frivolous garrulity, supercilious silence,
      a Democritus to laugh at everything and a Heraclitus to lament over
      everything. The work proceeded fast, and in twelve months was completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wanted something of the simplicity which had been among the most
      attractive charms of &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo;; but it furnished ample proof that the four
      years, which had elapsed since &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; appeared, had not been
      unprofitably spent. Those who saw &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; in manuscript pronounced it
      the best novel of the age. Mrs. Thrale laughed and wept over it. Crisp was
      even vehement in applause, and offered to insure the rapid and complete
      success of the book for half-a-crown. What Miss Burney received for the
      copyright is not mentioned in the &ldquo;Diary&rdquo;; but we have observed several
      expressions from which we infer that the sum was considerable. That the
      sale would be great, nobody could doubt; and Frances now had shrewd and
      experienced advisers, who would not suffer her to wrong herself. We have
      been told that the publishers gave her two thousand pounds, and we have no
      doubt that they might have given a still larger sum without being losers.<a
      href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16">[16]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; was published in the summer of 1782. The curiosity of the town
      was intense. We have been informed by persons who remember those days,
      that no romance of Sir Walter Scott was more impatiently awaited or more eagerly
      snatched from the counters of the booksellers. High as public expectation
      was, it was amply satisfied; and &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; was placed, by general
      acclamation, among the classical novels of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Burney was now thirty. Her youth had been singularly prosperous; but
      clouds soon began to gather over that clear and radiant dawn. Events
      deeply painful to a heart so kind as that of Frances followed each other
      in rapid succession. She was first called upon to attend the deathbed of
      her best friend, Samuel Crisp. When she returned to St. Martin's Street
      after performing this melancholy duty, she was appalled by hearing that
      Johnson had been struck with paralysis, and, not many months later, she
      parted from him for the last time with solemn tenderness. He wished to
      look on her once more; and on the day before his death she long remained
      in tears on the stairs leading to his bedroom, in the hope that she might
      be called in to receive his blessing. But he was then sinking fast, and,
      though he sent her an affectionate message, was unable to see her. But
      this was not the worst. There are separations far more cruel than those
      which are made by death. Frances might weep with proud affection for Crisp
      and Johnson. She had to blush as well as to weep for Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life, however, still smiled upon her. Domestic happiness, friendship,
      independence, leisure, letters, all these things were hers; and she flung
      them all away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the distinguished persons to whom Miss Burney had been introduced,
      none appears to have stood higher in her regard than Mrs. Delany. This
      lady was an interesting and venerable relic of a past age. She was the
      niece of George Granville, Lord Lansdowne, who, in his youth, exchanged
      verses and compliments with Edmund Waller, and who was among the first to
      applaud the opening talents of Pope. She had married Dr. Delany, a man
      known to his contemporaries as a profound scholar and eloquent preacher,
      but remembered in our time chiefly as one of that small circle in which
      the fierce spirit of Swift, tortured by disappointed ambition, by remorse,
      and by the approaches of madness, sought for amusement and repose. Dr.
      Delany had long been dead. His widow, nobly descended, eminently
      accomplished, and retaining, in spite of the infirmities of advanced age,
      the vigour of her faculties, and the serenity of her temper, enjoyed and
      deserved the favour of the royal family. She had a pension of three
      hundred a-year; and a house at Windsor, belonging to the crown, had been
      fitted up for her accommodation. At this house, the king and queen
      sometimes called, and found a very natural pleasure in thus catching an
      occasional glimpse of the private life of English families.
    </p>
    <p>
      In December, 1785, Miss Burney was on a visit to Mrs. Delany at Windsor.
      The dinner was over. The old lady was taking a nap. Her grandniece, a
      little girl of seven, was playing at some Christmas game with the
      visitors, when the door opened, and a stout gentleman entered unannounced,
      with a star on his breast, and &ldquo;What? what? what?&rdquo; in his mouth. A cry of
      &ldquo;The king!&rdquo; was set up. A general scampering followed. Miss Burney owns
      that she could not have been more terrified if she had seen a ghost. But
      Mrs. Delany came forward to pay her duty to her royal friend, and the
      disturbance was quieted. Frances was then presented, and underwent a long
      examination and cross-examination about all that she had written, and all
      that she meant to write. The queen soon made her appearance, and his
      majesty repeated, for the benefit of his consort, the information which he
      had extracted from Miss Burney. The good nature of the royal pair might
      have softened even the authors of the &ldquo;Probationary Odes,"<a
      href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17">[17]</a> and
      could not but be delightful to a young lady who had been brought up a
      Tory. In a few days the visit was repeated. Miss Burney was more at ease
      than before. His majesty, instead of seeking for information, condescended
      to impart it, and passed sentence on many great writers, English and
      foreign. Voltaire he pronounced a monster. Rousseau he liked rather
      better. &ldquo;But was there ever,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;such stuff as great part of
      Shakspeare? Only one must not say so. But what think you? What? Is there
      not sad stuff? What? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Frances enjoyed the privilege of listening to some equally
      valuable criticism uttered by the queen touching Goethe, and Klopstock,
      and might have learned an important lesson of economy from the mode in
      which her majesty's library had been formed. &ldquo;I picked the book up on a
      stall,&rdquo; said the queen. &ldquo;Oh, it is amazing what good books there are on
      stalls!&rdquo; Mrs. Delany, who seems to have understood from these words that
      her majesty was in the habit of exploring the booths of Moorfields and
      Holywell-street in person, could not suppress an exclamation of surprise.
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;I don't pick them up myself. I have a servant very
      clever; and if they are not to be had at the booksellers, they are not for
      me more than for another.&rdquo; Miss Burney describes this conversation as
      delightful; and, indeed, we cannot wonder that, with her literary tastes,
      she should be delighted at hearing in how magnificent a manner the
      greatest lady in the land encouraged literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, that Frances was fascinated by the condescending kindness of
      the two great personages to whom she had been presented. Her father was
      even more infatuated than herself. The result was a step of which we
      cannot think with patience, but recorded as it is with all its
      consequences in these volumes deserves at least this praise, that it has
      furnished a most impressive warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A German lady of the name of Haggerdorn, one of the keepers of the queen's
      robes, retired about this time, and her majesty offered the vacant post to
      Miss Burney. When we consider that Miss Burney was decidedly the most
      popular writer of fictitious narrative then living, that competence, if
      not opulence, was within her reach, and that she was more than usually
      happy in her domestic circle, and when we compare the sacrifice which she
      was invited to make with the remuneration which was held out to her, we
      are divided between laughter and indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was demanded of her was that she should consent to be almost as
      completely separated from her family and friends as if she had gone to
      Calcutta, and almost as close a prisoner as if she had been sent to gaol
      for a libel; that with talents which had instructed and delighted the
      highest living minds, she should now be employed only in mixing snuff and
      sticking pins; that she should be summoned by a waiting-woman's bell to a
      waiting-woman's duties; that she should pass her whole life under the
      restraints of a paltry etiquette, should sometimes fast till she was ready
      to swoon with hunger, should sometimes stand till her knees gave way with
      fatigue; that she should not dare to speak or move without considering how
      her mistress might like her words and gestures. Instead of those
      distinguished men and women, the flower of all political parties, with
      whom she had been in the habit of mixing on terms of equal friendship, she
      was to have for her perpetual companion the chief keeper of the robes, an
      old hag from Germany, of mean understanding, of insolent manners, and of
      temper which, naturally savage, had now been exasperated by disease. Now
      and then, indeed, poor Frances might console herself for the loss of
      Burke's and Windham's society by joining in the &ldquo;celestial colloquy
      sublime&rdquo; of his majesty's equerries.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was the consideration for which she was to sell herself to this
      slavery? A peerage in her own right? A pension of two thousand a-year for
      life? A seventy-four for her brother in the navy? A deanery for her
      brother in the church? Not so. The price at which she was valued was her
      board, her lodging, the attendance of a man-servant, and two hundred
      pounds a-year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who, even when hard pressed by hunger, sells his birthright for a
      mess of pottage, is unwise. But what shall we say of him who parts with
      his birthright and does not get even the pottage in return? It is not
      necessary to inquire whether opulence be an adequate compensation for the
      sacrifice of bodily and mental freedom; for Frances Burney paid for leave
      to be a prisoner and a menial. It was evidently understood as one of the
      terms of her engagement, that, while she was a member of the royal
      household, she was not to appear before the public as an author; and, even
      had there been no such understanding, her avocations were such as left her
      no leisure for any considerable intellectual effort. That her place was
      incompatible with her literary pursuits was indeed frankly acknowledged by
      the king when she resigned. &ldquo;She had given up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;five years of
      her pen.&rdquo; That during those five years she might, without painful
      exertion, without any exertion that would not have been a pleasure, have
      earned enough to buy an annuity for life much larger than the precarious
      salary which she received at Court, is quite certain. The same income,
      too, which in St. Martin's Street would have afforded her every comfort,
      must have been found scanty at St. James's. We cannot venture to speak
      confidently of the price of millinery and jewellery; but we are greatly
      deceived if a lady, who had to attend Queen Charlotte on many public
      occasions, could possibly save a farthing out of a salary of two hundred
      a-year. The principle of the arrangement was, in short, simply this, that
      Frances Burney should become a slave, and should be rewarded by being made
      a beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      With what object their majesties brought her to their palace, we must own
      ourselves unable to conceive. Their object could not be to encourage her
      literary exertions; for they took her from a situation in which it was
      almost certain that she would write and put her into a situation in which
      it was impossible for her to write. Their object could not be to promote
      her pecuniary interest for they took her from a situation where she was
      likely to become rich, and put her into a situation in which she could not
      but continue poor. Their object could not be to obtain an eminently useful
      waiting-maid; for it is clear that, though Miss Burney was the only woman
      of her time who could have described the death of Harrel,<a
      href="#linknote-18" name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18">[18]</a>
      thousands might have been found more expert in tying ribbons and filling
      snuff-boxes. To grant her a pension on the civil list would have been an
      act of judicious liberality honourable to the Court. If this was
      impracticable, the next best thing was to let her alone. That the king and
      queen meant her nothing but kindness, we do not in the least doubt. But
      their kindness was the kindness of persons raised high above the mass of
      mankind, accustomed to be addressed with profound deference, accustomed to
      see all who approach them mortified by their coldness and elated by their
      smiles. They fancied that to be noticed by them, to be near them, to serve
      them, was in itself a kind of happiness; and that Frances Burney ought to
      be full of gratitude for being permitted to purchase, by the surrender of
      health, wealth, freedom, domestic affection and literary fame, the
      privilege of standing behind a royal chair and holding a pair of royal
      gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who can blame them? Who can wonder that princes should be under such a
      delusion when they are encouraged in it by the very persons who suffer
      from it most cruelly? Was it to be expected that George III. and Queen
      Charlotte should understand the interest of Frances Burney better, or
      promote it with more zeal, than herself and her father? No deception was
      practised. The conditions of the house of bondage were set forth with all
      simplicity. The hook was presented without a bait; the net was spread in
      sight of the bird, and the naked hook was greedily swallowed, and the
      silly bird made haste to entangle herself in the net.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not strange indeed that an invitation to Court should have caused a
      fluttering in the bosom of an inexperienced woman. But it was the duty of
      the parent to watch over the child, and to show her, that on one side were
      only infantine vanities and chimerical hopes, on the other, liberty, peace
      of mind, affluence, social enjoyments, honourable distinctions. Strange to
      say, the only hesitation was on the part of Frances. Dr. Burney was
      transported out of himself with delight. Not such are the raptures of a
      Circassian father who has sold his pretty daughter well to a Turkish slave
      merchant. Yet Dr. Burney was an amiable man a man of good abilities, a man
      who had seen much of the world. But he seems to have thought that going to
      Court was like going to heaven; that to see princes and princesses was a
      kind of beatific vision; that the exquisite felicity enjoyed by royal
      persons was not confined to themselves, but was communicated by some
      mysterious efflux or reflection to all who were suffered to stand at their
      toilettes or to bear their trains. He overruled all his daughter's
      objections, and himself escorted her to prison. The door closed. The key
      was turned. She, looking back with tender regret on all she had left, and
      forward with anxiety and terror to the new life on which she was entering,
      was unable to speak or stand; and he went on his way homeward rejoicing in
      her marvellous prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now began a slavery of five years, of five years taken from the best
      part of life, and wasted in menial drudgery or in recreations duller than
      menial drudgery, under galling restraints and amidst unfriendly or
      uninteresting companions. The history of an ordinary day was this: Miss
      Burney had to rise and dress herself early, that she might be ready to
      answer the royal bell, which rang at half after seven. Till about eight
      she attended in the queen's dressing-room, and had the honour of lacing
      her august mistress's stays, and of putting on the hoop, gown, and
      neck-handkerchief. The morning was chiefly spent in rummaging drawers, and
      laying fine clothes in their proper places. Then the queen was to be
      powdered and dressed for the day. Twice a week her majesty's hair was
      curled and craped; and this operation appears to have added a full hour to
      the business of the toilette. It was generally three before Miss Burney
      was at liberty. Then she had two hours at her own disposal. To these hours
      we owe great Part of her &ldquo;Diary.&rdquo; At five she had to attend her colleague,
      Madame Schwellenberg, a hateful old toadeater, as illiterate as a
      chambermaid, as proud as a Whole German Chapter, rude, peevish, unable to
      bear solitude, unable to conduct herself with common decency in society.
      With this delightful associate, Frances Burney had to dine and pass the
      evening. The pair generally remained together from five to eleven, and
      often had no other company the whole time, except during the hour from
      eight to nine, when the equerries came to tea. If poor Frances attempted
      to escape to her own apartment, and to forget her wretchedness over a
      book, the execrable old woman railed and stormed, and complained that she
      was neglected. Yet, when Frances stayed, she was constantly assailed with
      insolent reproaches. Literary fame was, in the eyes of the German crone, a
      blemish, a proof that the person&mdash;who enjoyed it was meanly born, and
      out of the pale of good society. All her scanty stock of broken English
      was employed to express the contempt with which she regarded the author of
      &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo; Frances detested cards, and indeed knew nothing
      about them; but she soon found that the least miserable way of passing an
      evening with Madame Schwellenberg was at the card-table, and consented,
      with patient sadness, to give hours which might have called forth the
      laughter and tears of many generations to the king of clubs and the knave
      of spades. Between eleven and twelve, the bell rang again. Miss Burney had
      to pass twenty minutes or half an hour in undressing the queen, and was
      then at liberty to retire and to dream that she was chatting with her
      brother by the quiet hearth in St. Martin's Street, that she was the
      centre of an admiring assembly at Mrs. Crewe's, that Burke was calling her
      the first woman of the age, or that Dilly was giving her a cheque for two
      thousand guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men, we must suppose, are less patient than women; for we are utterly at a
      loss to conceive how any human being could endure such a life while there
      remained a vacant garret in Grub-street, a crossing in want of a sweeper,
      a parish workhouse or a parish vault. And it was for such a life that
      Frances Burney had given up liberty and peace, a happy fireside, attached
      friends, a wide and splendid circle of acquaintance, intellectual
      pursuits, in which she was qualified to excel, and the sure hope of what
      to her would have been affluence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing new under the sun. The last great master of Attic
      eloquence and Attic wit has left us a forcible and touching description of
      the misery of a man of letters, who, lulled by hopes similar to those of
      Frances, had entered the service of one of the magnates of Rome. &ldquo;Unhappy
      that I am,&rdquo; cries the victim of his own childish ambition: &ldquo;would nothing
      content me but that I must leave mine old pursuits and mine old
      companions, and the life which was without care, and the sleep which had
      no limit save mine own pleasure, and the walks which I was free to take
      where I listed, and fling myself into the lowest pit of a dungeon like
      this? And, O God! for what? Is this the bait which enticed me? Was there
      no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than
      those which I now earn by servitude? Like a lion which has been made so
      tame that men may lead him about by a thread, I am dragged up and down,
      with broken and humbled spirit, at the heels of those to whom, in my own
      domain, I should have been an object of awe and wonder. And, worst of all,
      I feel that here I gain no credit, that here I give no pleasure. The
      talents and accomplishments, which charmed a far different circle, are
      here out of place. I am rude in the arts of palaces, and can ill bear
      comparison with those whose calling from their youth up has been to
      flatter and to sue. Have I, then, two lives, that, after I have wasted one
      in the service of others, there may yet remain to me a second, which I may
      live unto myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, indeed, events occurred which disturbed the wretched
      monotony of Francis Burney's life. The Court moved from Kew to Windsor,
      and from Windsor back to Kew. One dull colonel went out of waiting, and
      another dull colonel came into waiting. An impertinent servant made a
      blunder about tea, and caused a misunderstanding between the gentlemen and
      the ladies. A half-witted French Protestant minister talked oddly about
      conjugal fidelity. An unlucky member of the household mentioned a passage
      in the &ldquo;Morning Herald&rdquo; reflecting on the queen; and forthwith Madame
      Schwellenberg, began to storm in bad English, and told him that he had
      made her &ldquo;what you call perspire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A more important occurrence was the royal visit to Oxford. Miss Burney
      went in the queen's train to Nuneham, was utterly neglected there in the
      crowd, and could with difficulty find a servant to show the way to her
      bedroom or a hairdresser to arrange her curls. She had the honour of
      entering Oxford in the last of a long string of carriages which formed the
      royal procession, of walking after the queen all day through refectories
      and chapels and of standing, half dead with fatigue and hunger, while her
      august mistress was seated at an excellent cold collation. At Magdalene
      college, Frances was left for a moment in a parlour, where she sank down
      on a chair. A good-natured equerry saw that she was exhausted, and shared
      with her some apricots and bread which he had wisely put into his pockets.
      At that moment the door opened; the queen entered; the wearied attendants
      sprang up; the bread and fruit were hastily concealed. &ldquo;I found,&rdquo; says
      poor Miss Burney, &ldquo;that our appetites were to be supposed annihilated at
      the same moment that our strength was to be invincible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet Oxford, seen even under such disadvantages, &ldquo;revived in her,&rdquo; to use
      her own words, a &ldquo;consciousness to pleasure which had long lain nearly
      dormant.&rdquo; She forgot, during one moment, that she was a waiting-maid, and
      felt as a woman of true genius might be expected to feel amidst venerable
      remains of antiquity, beautiful works of art, vast repositories of
      knowledge, and memorials of the illustrious dead. Had she still been what
      she was before her father induced her to take the most fatal step of her
      life, we can easily imagine what pleasure she would have derived from a
      visit to the noblest of English cities. She might, indeed, have been
      forced to ride in a hack chaise, and might not have worn so fine a gown of
      Chambery gauze as that in which she tottered after the royal party; but
      with what delight would she have then paced the cloisters of Magdalene,
      compared the antique gloom of Merton with the splendour of Christchurch,
      and looked down from the dome of the Radcliffe library on the magnificent
      sea of turrets and battlements below! How gladly should learned men have
      laid aside for a few hours Pindar's &ldquo;Odes&rdquo; and Aristotle's &ldquo;Ethics,&rdquo; to
      escort the author of &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; from college to college! What neat little
      banquets would she have found set out in their monastic cells! With what
      eagerness would pictures, medals, and illuminated missals have been
      brought forth from the most mysterious cabinets for her amusement! How
      much she would have had to hear and to tell about Johnson, as she walked
      over Pembroke, and about Reynolds, in the antechapel of New college. But
      these indulgences were not for one who had sold herself into bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eighteen months after the visit to Oxford, another event diversified
      the wearisome life which Frances led at Court. Warren Hastings was brought
      to the bar of the House of Peers. The queen and princesses were present
      when the trial commenced, and Miss Burney was permitted to attend. During
      the subsequent proceedings, a day rule for the same purpose was
      occasionally granted to her; for the queen took the strongest interest in
      the trial, and, when she could not go herself to Westminster-hall, liked
      to receive a report of what passed from a person who had singular powers
      of observation, and who was, moreover, personally acquainted with some of
      the most distinguished managers. The portion of the &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; which relates
      to this celebrated proceeding is lively and picturesque. Yet we read it,
      we own, with pain; for it seems to us to prove that the fine understanding
      of Frances Burney was beginning to feel the pernicious influence of a mode
      of life which is as incompatible with health of mind as the air of the
      Pontine marshes with health of body. From the first day, she espouses the
      cause of Hastings with a presumptuous vehemence and acrimony quite
      inconsistent with the modesty and suavity of her ordinary deportment. She
      shudders when Burke enters the Hall at the head of the Commons. She
      pronounces him the cruel oppressor of an innocent man. She is at a loss to
      conceive how the managers can look at the defendant and not blush. Windham
      comes to her from the managers' box, to offer her refreshment. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says
      she, &ldquo;I could not break bread with him.&rdquo; Then again, she exclaims, &ldquo;Ah,
      Mr. Windham, how come you ever engaged in so cruel, so unjust a cause?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Mr. Burke saw me,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and he bowed with the most marked civility
      of manner.&rdquo; This, be it observed, was just after his opening speech, a
      speech which had produced a mighty effect, and which certainly, no other
      orator that ever lived could have made. &ldquo;My curtsy,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;was
      the most ungrateful, distant and cold; I could not do otherwise; so hurt I
      felt to see him the head of such a cause.&rdquo; Now, not only had Burke treated
      her with constant kindness, but the very last act which he performed on
      the day on which he was turned out of the Pay office, about four years
      before this trial, was to make Dr. Burney organist of Chelsea hospital.
      When, at the Westminster election, Dr. Burney was divided between his
      gratitude for this favour and his Tory opinions, Burke in the noblest
      manner disclaimed all right to exact a sacrifice of principle. &ldquo;You have
      little or no obligations to me,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;but if you had as many as I
      really wish it were in my power, as it is certainly in my desire, to lay
      on you, I hope you do not think me capable of conferring them in order to
      subject your mind or your affairs to a painful and mischievous servitude.&rdquo;
       Was this a man to be uncivilly treated by a daughter of Dr. Burney because
      she chose to differ from him respecting a vast and most complicated
      question which he had studied deeply, requiring many years and which she
      had never studied at all? It Is clear, from Miss Burney's own statement,
      that when she behaved so unkindly to Mr. Burke, she did not even know of
      what Hastings was accused. One thing, however, she must have known, that
      Burke had been able to convince a House of Commons, bitterly prejudiced
      against him, that the charges were well founded, and that Pitt and Dundas
      had concurred with Fox and Sheridan in supporting the impeachment. Surely
      a woman of far inferior abilities to Miss Burney might have been expected
      to see that this never could have happened unless there had been a strong
      case against the late Governor-general. And there was, as all reasonable
      men now admit, a strong case against him. That there were great public
      services to be set off against his great crimes is perfectly true. But his
      services and his crimes were equally unknown to the lady who so
      confidently asserted his perfect innocence, and imputed to his accusers&mdash;that
      is to say, to all the greatest men of all parties in the state&mdash;not
      merely error, but gross injustice and barbarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, it is true, occasionally seen Mr. Hastings, and had found his
      manners and conversation agreeable. But surely she could not be so weak as
      to infer from the gentleness of his deportment in a drawing-room that he
      was incapable of committing a great state crime under the influence of
      ambition and revenge. A silly Miss, fresh from a boarding&mdash;school,
      might fall into such a mistake; but the woman who had drawn the character
      of Mr. Monckton<a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19"
       id="linknoteref-19">[19]</a> should have known better.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that she had been too long at Court. She was sinking into a
      slavery worse than that of the body. The iron was beginning to enter into
      the soul. Accustomed during many months to watch the eye of a mistress, to
      receive with boundless gratitude the slightest mark of royal
      condescension, to feel wretched at every symptom of royal displeasure, to
      associate only with spirits long tamed and broken in, she was degenerating&mdash;into
      something fit for her place. Queen Charlotte was a violent partisan of
      Hastings, had received presents from him, and had so far departed from the
      severity of her virtue as to lend her countenance to his wife, whose
      conduct had certainly been as reprehensible as that of any of the frail
      beauties who were then rigidly excluded from the English Court. The king,
      it was well known, took the same side. To the king and queen, all the
      members of the household looked submissively for guidance. The
      impeachment, therefore, was an atrocious persecution; the managers were
      rascals; the defendant was the most deserving and the worst used man in
      the kingdom. This was the cant of the whole palace, from gold stick in
      waiting down to the table-deckers and yeomen of the silver scullery; and
      Miss Burney canted like the rest, though in livelier tones and with less
      bitter feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account which she has given of the king's illness contains much
      excellent narrative and description, and will, we think, be more valued by
      the historians of a future age than any equal portion of Pepys' or
      Evelyn's &ldquo;Diaries.&rdquo; That account shows also how affectionate and
      compassionate her nature was, but it shows also, we must say, that her way
      of life was rapidly impairing her powers of reasoning and her sense of
      justice. We do not mean to discuss, in this place, the question whether
      the views of Mr. Pitt or those of Mr. Fox respecting the regency were the
      more correct. It is, indeed, quite needless to discuss that question; for
      the censure of Miss Burney falls alike on Pitt and Fox, on majority and
      minority. She is angry with the House of Commons for presuming to inquire
      whether the king was mad or not and whether there was a chance of his
      recovering his senses. &ldquo;Melancholy day,&rdquo; she writes; &ldquo;news bad both at
      home and abroad. At home the dear unhappy king still worse; abroad new
      examinations voted of the physicians. Good heavens! what an insult does
      this seem from Parliamentary power, to investigate and bring forth to the
      world every circumstance of such a malady as is ever held sacred to
      secrecy in the most private families! How indignant we all feel here, no
      words can say.&rdquo; It is proper to observe that the motion which roused the
      indignation at Kew was made by Mr. Pitt himself, and that if withstood by
      Mr. Pitt, it would certainly have been rejected. We see therefore, that
      the loyalty of the minister, who was then generally regarded as the most
      heroic champion of his prince, was lukewarm indeed when compared with the
      boiling zeal which filled the pages of the backstairs and the women of the
      bedchamber. Of the Regency bill, Pitt's own bill, Miss Burney speaks with
      horror. &ldquo;I shuddered,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;to hear it named.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;Oh, how
      dreadful will be the day when that unhappy bill takes place! I cannot
      approve the plan of it.&rdquo; The truth is that Mr. Pitt, whether a wise and
      upright statesman or not, was a statesman, and, whatever motives he might
      have for imposing restrictions on the regent, felt that in some way or
      other there must be some provision made for the execution of some part of
      the kingly office, or that no government would be left in the country. But
      this was a matter of which the household never thought. It never occurred,
      as far as we can see, to the exons and keepers of the robes that it was
      necessary that there should be somewhere or other a power in the state to
      pass laws, to observe order, to pardon criminals, to fill up offices, to
      negotiate with foreign governments, to command the army and navy. Nay,
      these enlightened politicians, and Miss Burney among the rest, seem to
      have thought that any person who considered the subject with reference to
      the public interest showed himself to be a bad-hearted man. Nobody wonders
      at this in a gentleman usher, but it is melancholy to see genius sinking
      into such debasement.
    </p>
    <p>
      During more than two years after the king's recovery, Frances dragged on a
      miserable existence at the palace. The consolations which had for a time
      mitigated the wretchedness of servitude were one by one withdrawn. Mrs.
      Delany, whose society had been a great resource when the Court was at
      Windsor, was now dead. One of the gentlemen of the royal establishment,
      Colonel Digby,<a href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20"
       id="linknoteref-20">[20]</a> appears to have been a man of sense, of
      taste, of some reading, and of prepossessing manners. Agreeable associates
      were scarce in the prison house, and he and Miss Burney therefore
      naturally were attached to each other. She owns that she valued him as a
      friend, and it would not have been strange if his attentions had led her
      to entertain for him a sentiment warmer than friendship. He quitted the
      Court, and married in a way which astonished Miss Burney greatly, and
      which evidently wounded her feelings and lowered him in her esteem. The
      palace grew duller and duller; Madame Schwellenberg became more and more
      savage and insolent; and now the health of poor Frances began to give way;
      and all who saw her pale face, and emaciated figure and her feeble walk
      predicted that her sufferings would soon be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances uniformly speaks of her royal mistress and of the princesses with
      respect and affection. The princesses seem to have well-deserved all the
      praise which is bestowed on them in the &ldquo;Diary.&rdquo; They were, we doubt not,
      most amiable women. But &ldquo;the sweet queen,&rdquo; as she is constantly called in
      these volumes, is not by any means an object of admiration to us. She had,
      undoubtedly, sense enough to know what kind of deportment suited her high
      station, and self-command enough to maintain that deportment invariably.
      She was, in her intercourse with Miss Burney, generally gracious and
      affable, sometimes, when displeased, cold and reserved, but never, under
      any circumstances, rude, peevish or violent. She knew how to dispense,
      gracefully and skilfully, those little civilities which, when paid by a
      sovereign, are prized at many times their intrinsic value; how to pay a
      compliment; how to lend a book; how to ask after a relation. But she seems
      to have been utterly regardless of the comfort, the health, the life of
      her attendants, when her own convenience was concerned. Weak, feverish,
      hardly able to stand, Frances had still to rise before seven, in order to
      dress &ldquo;the sweet queen,&rdquo; and to sit up till midnight, in order to undress
      &ldquo;the sweet queen.&rdquo; The indisposition of the handmaid could not, and did
      not, escape the notice of her royal mistress. But the established doctrine
      of the Court was that all sickness was to be considered as a pretence
      until it proved fatal. The only way in which the invalid could clear
      herself from the suspicion of malingering, as it is called in the army,
      was to go on lacing and unlacing, till she fell down dead at the royal
      feet. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Miss Burney wrote, when she was suffering cruelly from
      sickness, watching and labour, &ldquo;is by no means from hardness of heart; far
      otherwise. There is no hardness of heart in any one of them but it is
      prejudice and want of personal experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many strangers sympathised with the bodily and mental sufferings of this
      distinguished woman. All who saw her saw that her frame was sinking, that
      her heart was breaking. The last, it should seem, to observe the change
      was her father. At length, in spite of himself, his eyes were opened. In
      May, 1790, his daughter had an interview of three hours with him, the only
      long interview which they had had since he took her to Windsor in 1786.
      She told him that she was miserable, that she was worn with attendance and
      want of sleep, that she had no comfort in life, nothing to love, nothing
      to hope, that her family and friends were to her as though they were not,
      and were remembered by her as men remember the dead. From daybreak to
      midnight the same killing labour, the same recreations, more hateful than
      labour itself, followed each other without variety, without any interval
      of liberty and repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was greatly dejected by this news; but was too good-natured a
      man not to say that, if she wished to resign, his house and arms were open
      to her. Still, however, he could not bear to remove her from the Court.
      His veneration for royalty amounted in truth to idolatry. It can be
      compared only to the grovelling superstition of those Syrian devotees who
      made their children pass through the fire to Moloch. When he induced his
      daughter to accept the place of keeper of the robes, he entertained, as
      she tells us, a hope that some worldly advantage or other, not set down in
      the contract of service, would be the result of her connection with the
      Court. What advantage he expected we do not know, nor did he probably know
      himself. But, whatever he expected, he certainly got nothing. Miss Burney
      had been hired for board, lodging and two hundred a-year. Board, lodging
      and two hundred a-year she had duly received. We have looked carefully
      through the &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; in the hope of finding some trace of those
      extraordinary benefactions on which the doctor reckoned. But we can
      discover only a promise, never performed, of a gown:<a href="#linknote-21"
       name="linknoteref-21" id="linknoteref-21">[21]</a> and for this promise
      Miss Burney was expected to return thanks, such as might have suited the
      beggar with whom Saint Martin, in the legend, divided his cloak. The
      experience of four years was, however, insufficient to dispel the illusion
      which had taken possession of the doctor's mind; and between the dear
      father and &ldquo;the sweet queen&rdquo; there seemed to be little doubt that some day
      or other Frances would drop down a corpse. Six months had elapsed since
      the interview between the parent and the daughter. The resignation was not
      sent in. The sufferer grew worse and worse. She took bark, but it soon
      ceased to produce a beneficial effect. She was stimulated with wine; she
      was soothed with opium; but in vain. Her breath began to fail. The whisper
      that she was in a decline spread through the Court. The pains in her side
      became so severe that she was forced to crawl from the card-table of the
      old Fury to whom she was tethered three or four times in an evening for
      the purpose of taking hartshorn. Had she been a negro slave, a humane
      planter would have excused her from work. But her majesty showed no mercy.
      Thrice a day the accursed bell still rang; the queen was still to be
      dressed for the morning at seven, and to be dressed for the day at noon,
      and to be undressed at eleven at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there had arisen, in literary and fashionable society, a general
      feeling of compassion for Miss Burney, and of indignation against both her
      father and the queen. &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said a great French lady to the
      doctor &ldquo;that your daughter is in a situation where she is never allowed a
      holiday?&rdquo; Horace Walpole wrote to Frances to express his sympathy.
      Boswell, boiling over with good-natured rage, almost forced an entrance
      into the palace to see her. &ldquo;My dear ma'am, why do you stay? It won't do,
      ma'am&mdash;you must resign. We can put up with it no longer. Some very
      violent measures, I assure you, will be taken. We shall address Dr. Burney
      in a body.&rdquo; Burke and Reynolds, though less noisy, were zealous in the
      same cause. Windham spoke to Dr. Burney, but found him still irresolute.
      &ldquo;I will set the club upon him,&rdquo; cried Windham; &ldquo;Miss Burney has some very
      true admirers there, and I am sure they will eagerly assist.&rdquo; Indeed, the
      Burney family seem to have been apprehensive that some public affront,
      such as the doctor's unpardonable folly, to use the mildest term had
      richly deserved, would be put upon him. The medical men spoke out, and
      plainly told him that his daughter must resign or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last paternal affection, medical authority, and the voice of all London
      crying shame, triumphed over Dr. Burney's love of courts. He determined
      that Frances should write a letter of resignation. It was with difficulty
      that, though her life was at stake, she mustered spirit to put the paper
      into the queen's hands. &ldquo;I could not,&rdquo; so runs the 'Diary', summon courage
      to present my memorial&mdash;my heart always failed me from seeing the
      queen's entire freedom from such an expectation. For though I was
      frequently so ill in her presence that I could hardly stand, I saw she
      concluded me, while life remained, inevitably hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, with a trembling hand, the paper was delivered. Then came the
      storm. Juno, as in the Aeneid, delegated the work of vengeance to Alecto.
      The queen was calm and gentle, but Madame Schwellenberg raved like a
      maniac in the incurable ward of Bedlam! Such insolence! Such ingratitude!
      Such folly! Would Miss Burney bring utter destruction on herself and her
      family? Would she throw away the inestimable advantages of royal
      protection? Would she part with privileges which, once relinquished, could
      never be regained? It was idle to talk of health and life. If people could
      not live in the palace, the best thing that could befall them was to die
      in it. The resignation was not accepted. The language of the medical men
      became stronger and stronger. Dr. Burney's parental fears were fully
      roused; and he explicitly declared, in a letter meant to be shown to the
      queen, that his daughter must retire. The Schwellenberg raged like a wild
      cat. &ldquo;A scene almost horrible ensued,&rdquo; says Miss Burney. &ldquo;She was too much
      enraged for disguise, and uttered the most furious expressions of
      indignant contempt at our proceedings. I am sure she would gladly have
      confined us both in the Bastille, had England such a misery, as a fit
      place to bring us to ourselves, from a daring so outrageous against
      imperial wishes.&rdquo; This passage deserves notice, as being the only one in
      in her &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; as far as we have observed, which shows Miss Burney to
      have been aware that she was a native of a free country, and she could not
      be pressed for a waiting-maid against her will, that she had just as good
      a right to live, if she chose, in St.-Martin's-street as Queen Charlotte
      had to live at St. James's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen promised that, after the next birthday, Miss Burney would be set
      at liberty. But the promise was ill kept; and her Majesty showed
      displeasure at being reminded of it. At length Frances was informed that
      in a fortnight her attendance should cease. &ldquo;I heard this,&rdquo; she says,
      &ldquo;with a fearful presentiment I should surely never go through another
      fortnight in so weak and languishing and painful a state of health.... As
      the time of separation approached, the queen's cordiality rather
      diminished, and traces of internal displeasure appeared sometimes, arising
      from an opinion I ought rather to have struggled on, live or die, than to
      quit her. Yet I am sure she saw how poor was my own chance, except by a
      change in the mode of life, and at least ceased to wonder, though she
      could not approve.&rdquo; Sweet queen! What noble candour, to admit that the
      undutifulness of people who did not think the honour of adjusting her
      tuckers worth the sacrifice of their own lives, was, though highly
      criminal, not altogether unnatural!

      We perfectly understand her majesty's contempt for the lives of others
      where her own pleasure was concerned. But what pleasure she can have found
      in having Miss Burney about her, it is not so easy to comprehend. That
      Miss Burney was an eminently skilful keeper of the robes is not very
      probable. Few women, indeed, had paid less attention to dress. Now and
      then, in the course of five years, she had been asked to read aloud or to
      write a copy of verses. But better readers might easily have been found:
      and her verses were worse than even the Poet Laureate's Birthday odes.
      Perhaps that economy, which was among her majesty's most conspicuous
      virtues, had something to do with her conduct on this occasion. Miss
      Burney had never hinted that she expected a retiring pension; and, indeed,
      would gladly have given the little that she had for freedom. But her
      majesty knew what the public thought, and what became her own dignity. She
      could not for very shame suffer a woman of distinguished genius, who had
      quitted a lucrative career to wait on her, who had served her faithfully
      for a pittance during five years, and whose constitution had been impaired
      by labour and watching, to leave the Court without some mark of royal
      liberality. George III., who, on all occasions where Miss Burney was
      concerned, seems to have behaved like an honest, good-natured gentleman,
      felt this, and said plainly that she was entitled to a provision. At
      length, in return for all the misery which she had undergone, and for the
      health which she had sacrificed, an annuity of one hundred pounds was
      granted to her, dependent on the queen's pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the prison was opened, and Frances was free once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson, as Burke observed, might have added a striking page to his &ldquo;The
      Vanity of Human Wishes,&rdquo; if he had lived to see his little Burney as she
      went into the palace and as she came out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasures, so long untasted, of liberty, of friendship, of domestic
      affection, were almost too acute for her shattered frame. But happy days
      and tranquil nights soon restored the health which the queen's toilette
      and Madame Schwellenberg's card-table had impaired. Kind and anxious faces
      surrounded the invalid. Conversation the most polished and brilliant
      revived her spirits. Travelling was recommended to her; and she rambled by
      easy journeys from cathedral to cathedral, and from watering place to
      watering place. She crossed the New forest, and visited Stonehenge and
      Wilton, the cliffs of Lyme, and the beautiful valley of Sidmouth. Thence
      she journeyed by Powderham castle, and by the ruins of Glastonbury abbey
      to Bath, and from Bath, when the winter was approaching, returned well and
      cheerful to London. There she visited her old dungeon, and found her
      successor already far on the way to the grave, and kept to strict duty,
      from morning till midnight, with a sprained ankle and a nervous fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time England swarmed with French exiles, driven from their country
      by the Revolution. A colony of these refugees settled at juniper hall, in
      Surrey, not far from Norbury park, where Mr. Locke, an intimate friend of
      the Burney family, resided. Frances visited Norbury, and was introduced to
      the strangers. She had strong prejudices against them; for her Toryism was
      far beyond, we do not say that of Mr. Pitt, but that of Mr. Reeves; and
      the inmates of Juniper Hall were all attached to the constitution of 1791,
      and were, therefore, more detested by the royalists of the first
      emigration than Petion or Marat. But such a woman as Miss Burney could not
      long resist the fascination of that remarkable society. She had lived with
      Johnson and Windham, with Mrs. Montague and Mrs. Thrale. Yet she was
      forced to own that she had never heard conversation before. The most
      animated eloquence, the keenest observation, the most sparkling wit, the
      most courtly grace, were united to charm her. For Madame de Staël was
      there, and M. de Talleyrand. There, too, was M. de Narbonne, a noble
      representative of French aristocracy; and with M. de Narbonne was his
      friend and follower General D'Arblay, an honourable and amiable man, with
      a handsome person, frank soldier-like manners, and some taste for letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prejudices which Frances had conceived against the constitutional
      royalists of France rapidly vanished. She listened with rapture to
      Talleyrand and Madame de Staël, joined with M. D'Arblay in execrating the
      Jacobins and in weeping for the unhappy Bourbons, took French lessons from
      him, fell in love with him, and married him on no better provision than a
      precarious annuity of one hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; stops for the present.<a href="#linknote-22"
       name="linknoteref-22" id="linknoteref-22">[22]</a> We will, therefore,
      bring our narrative to a speedy close, by rapidly recounting the most
      important events which we know to have befallen Madame d'Arblay during the
      latter part of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. D'Arblay's fortune had perished in the general wreck of the French
      Revolution;&mdash;and in a foreign country his talents, whatever they may
      have been, could scarcely make him rich. The task of providing for the
      family devolved on his wife. In the year 1796, she published by
      subscription her third novel, &ldquo;Camilla.&rdquo; It was impatiently expected by
      the public; and the sum which she obtained for it was, we believe, greater
      than had ever at that time been received for a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard that she had cleared more than three thousand guineas. But
      we give this merely as a rumour.<a href="#linknote-23"
       name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23">[23]</a> &ldquo;Camilla,&rdquo; however,
      never attained popularity like that which &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; had
      enjoyed; and it must be allowed that there was a perceptible falling off,
      not, indeed, in humour or in power of portraying character, but in grace
      and in purity of style.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard that, about this time, a tragedy by Madame D'Arblay was
      performed without success. We do not know whether it was ever printed;
      nor, indeed, have we had time to make any researches into its history or
      merits.<a href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24" id="linknoteref-24">[24]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the short truce which followed the treaty of Amiens, M. D'Arblay
      visited France. Lauriston and La Fayette represented his claims to the
      French government, and obtained a promise that he should be reinstated in
      his military rank. M. D'Arblay, however, insisted that he should never be
      required to serve against the countrymen of his wife. The First Consul, of
      course, would not hear of such a condition, and ordered the general's
      commission to be instantly revoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay joined her husband at Paris, a short time before the war
      of 1803 broke out, and remained in France ten years, cut off from almost
      all intercourse with the land of her birth. At length, when Napoleon was
      on his march to Moscow, she with great difficulty obtained from his
      ministers permission to visit her own country, in company with her son,
      who was a native of England. She returned in time to receive the last
      blessing of her father, who died in his eighty-seventh year. In 1814 she
      published her last novel, &ldquo;The Wanderer,&rdquo; a book which no judicious friend
      to her memory will attempt to draw from the oblivion into which it has
      justly fallen.<a href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25"
       id="linknoteref-25">[25]</a> In the same year her son Alexander was sent
      to Cambridge. He obtained an honourable place among the wranglers of his
      year, and was elected a fellow of Christ's college. But his reputation at
      the University was higher than might be inferred from his success in
      academical contests. His French education had not fitted him for the
      examinations of the Senate house; but, in pure mathematics, we have been
      assured by some of his competitors that he had very few equals. He went
      into the Church, and it was thought likely that he would attain high
      eminence as a preacher; but he died before his mother. All that we have
      heard of him leads us to believe that he was such a son as such a mother
      deserved to have. In 1831, Madame D'Arblay published the memoirs of her
      father; and on the sixth of January, 1840, she died in her eighty-eighth
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now turn from the life of Madame D'Arblay to her writings. There can,
      we apprehend, be little difference of opinion as to the nature of her
      merit, whatever differences may exist as to its degree. She was
      emphatically what Johnson called her, a character-monger. It was in the
      exhibition of human passions and whims that her strength lay; and in this
      department of art she had, we think, very distinguished skill. But, in
      order that we may, according to our duty as kings at arms, versed in the
      laws of literary precedence, marshal her to the exact seat to which she is
      entitled, we must carry our examination somewhat further.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, in one respect, a remarkable analogy between the faces and the
      minds of men. No two faces are alike; and yet very few faces deviate very
      widely from the common standard. Among the eighteen hundred thousand human
      beings who inhabit London, there is not one who could be taken by his
      acquaintance for another; yet we may walk from Paddington to Mile-end
      without seeing one person in whom any feature is so overcharged that we
      turn round to stare at it. An infinite number of varieties lies between
      limits which are not very far asunder. The specimens which pass those
      limits on either side, form a very small minority.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the same with the characters of men. Here, too, the variety passes
      all enumeration. But the cases in which the deviation from the common
      standard is striking and grotesque, are very few. In one mind avarice
      predominates; in another pride; in a third, love of pleasure&mdash;just as
      in one countenance the nose is the most marked feature, while in others
      the chief expression lies in the brow, or in the lines of the mouth. But
      there are very few countenances in which nose, brow, and mouth do not
      contribute, though in unequal degrees, to the general effect; and so there
      are very few characters in which one overgrown propensity makes all others
      utterly insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident that a portrait painter, who was able only to represent
      faces and figures such as those&mdash;which we pay money to see at fairs,
      would not, however spirited his execution might be, take rank among the
      highest artists. He must always be placed below those who have skill to
      seize peculiarities which do not amount to deformity. The slighter those
      peculiarities, the greater is the merit of the limner who can catch them
      and transfer them to his canvas. To paint Daniel Lambert or the living
      skeleton, the pig-faced lady or the Siamese twins, so that nobody can
      mistake them, is an exploit within the reach of a sign painter. A
      third-rate artist might give us the squint of Wilkes, and the depressed
      nose and protuberant cheeks of Gibbon. It would require a much higher
      degree of skill to paint two such men as Mr. Canning and Sir Thomas
      Lawrence, so that nobody who had ever seen them could for a moment
      hesitate to assign each picture to its original. Here the mere
      caricaturist would be quite at fault. He would find in neither face
      anything on which he could lay hold for the purpose of making a
      distinction. Two ample bald foreheads, two regular profiles, two full
      faces of the same oval form, would baffle his art; and he would be reduced
      to the miserable shift of writing their names at the foot of his picture.
      Yet there was a great difference; and a person who had seen them once
      would no more have mistaken one of them for the other than he would have
      mistaken Mr. Pitt for Mr. Fox. But the difference lay in delicate
      lineaments and shades, reserved for pencils of a rare order.
    </p>
    <p>
      This distinction runs through all the imitative arts. Foote's mimicry was
      exquisitely ludicrous, but it was all caricature. He could take off only
      some strange peculiarity, a stammer or a lisp, a Northumbrian burr or an
      Irish brogue, a stoop or a shuffle. &ldquo;If a man,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;hops on one
      leg, Foote can hop on one leg.&rdquo; Garrick, on the other hand, could seize
      those differences of manner and pronunciation, which, though highly
      characteristic, are yet too slight to be described. Foote, we have no
      doubt, could have made the Haymarket theatre shake with laughter by
      imitating a conversation between a Scotchman and a Somersetshire man. But
      Garrick could have imitated a dialogue between two fashionable men both
      models of the best breeding, Lord Chesterfield, for example, and Lord
      Albemarle, so that no person could doubt which was which, although no
      person could say that, in any point, either Lord Chesterfield or Lord
      Albemarle spoke or moved otherwise than in conformity with the usages of
      the best society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same distinction is found in the drama, and in fictitious narrative.
      Highest among those who have exhibited human nature by means of dialogue,
      stands Shakspeare. His variety is like the variety of nature, endless
      diversity, scarcely any monstrosity. The characters of which he has given
      us an impression as vivid as that which we receive from the characters of
      our own associates, are to be reckoned by scores. Yet in all these scores
      hardly one character is to be found which deviates widely from the common
      standard, and which we should call very eccentric if we met it in real
      life. The silly notion that every man has one ruling passion, and that
      this clue, once known, unravels all the mysteries of his conduct, finds no
      countenance in the plays of Shakspeare. There man appears as he is, made
      up of a crowd of passions, which contend for the mastery over him, and
      govern him in turn. What is Hamlet's ruling passion? Or Othello's? Or
      Harry the Fifth's? Or Wolsey's? Or Lear's? Or Shylock's? Or Benedick's? Or
      Macbeth's? Or that of Cassius? Or that of Falconbridge? But we might go on
      for ever. Take a single example&mdash;Shylock. Is he so eager for money as
      to be indifferent to revenge? Or so eager for revenge as to be indifferent
      to money? Or so bent on both together as to be indifferent to the honour
      of his nation and the law of Moses? All his propensities are mingled with
      each other, so that, in trying to apportion to each its proper part, we
      find the same difficulty which constantly meets us in real life. A
      superficial critic may say that hatred is Shylock's ruling passion. But
      how many passions have amalgamated to form that hatred? It is partly the
      result of wounded pride: Antonio has called him dog. It is partly the
      result of covetousness: Antonio has hindered him of half a million; and
      when Antonio is gone, there will be no limit to the gains of usury. It is
      partly the result of national and religious feeling: Antonio has spit on
      the Jewish gaberdine; and the oath of revenge has been sworn by the Jewish
      Sabbath. We might go through all the characters which we have mentioned,
      and through fifty more in the same way; for it is the constant manner of
      Shakspeare to represent the human mind as lying, not under the absolute
      dominion of one despotic propensity, but under a mixed government in which
      a hundred powers balance each other. Admirable as he was in all parts of
      his art, we most admire him for this, that while he has left us a greater
      number of striking portraits than all other dramatists put together, he
      has scarcely left us a single caricature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakspeare has had neither equal nor second. But among the writers who, in
      the point which we have noticed, have approached nearest to the manner of
      the great master, we have no hesitation in placing Jane Austen, a woman of
      whom England is justly proud. She has given us a multitude of characters,
      all, in a certain sense, common-place, all such as we meet every day, yet
      they are all as perfectly discriminated from each other as if they were
      the most eccentric of human beings. There are, for example, four
      clergymen, none of whom we should be surprised to find in any parsonage in
      the kingdom&mdash;Mr. Edward Ferrers, Mr. Henry Tilney, Mr. Edmund
      Bertram, and Mr. Elton. They are all specimens of the upper part of the
      middle class. They have been liberally educated. They all lie under the
      restraints of the same sacred profession. They are all young. They are all
      in love. Not one of them has any hobbyhorse, to use the phrase of Sterne.
      Not one has a ruling passion, such as we read of in Pope. Who would not
      have expected them to be insipid likenesses of each other? No such thing.
      Harpagon is not more unlike to Jourdain, Joseph Surface is not more unlike
      to Sir Lucius O'Trigger, than every one of Miss Austen's young divines to
      all his reverend brethren. And almost all this is done by touches so
      delicate that they elude analysis, that they defy the powers of
      description, and that we know them to exist only by the general effect to
      which they have contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A line must be drawn, we conceive, between artists of this class and those
      poets and novelists whose skill lies in the exhibiting of what Ben Jonson
      called humours. The words of Ben are so much to the purpose that we will
      quote them:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;When some one peculiar quality
     Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw
     All his affects, his spirits and his powers,
     In their confluxions all to run one way,
     This may be truly said to be a humour.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There are undoubtedly persons in whom humours such as Ben describes have
      attained a complete ascendancy. The avarice of Elwes, the insane desire of
      Sir Egerton Brydges for a barony, to which he had no more right than to
      the crown of Spain, the malevolence which long meditation on imaginary
      wrongs generated in the gloomy mind of Bellingham, are instances. The
      feeling which animated Clarkson and other virtuous men against the slave
      trade and slavery, is an instance of a more honourable kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that such humours exist, we cannot deny that they are proper
      subjects for the imitations of art. But we conceive that the imitation of
      such humours, however skilful and amusing, is not an achievement of the
      highest order; and, as such humours are rare in real life, they ought, we
      conceive, to be sparingly introduced into works which profess to be
      pictures of real life. Nevertheless, a writer may show so much genius in
      the exhibition of these humours as to be fairly entitled to a
      distinguished and permanent rank among classics. The chief seats of all,
      however, the places on the dais and under the canopy, are reserved for the
      few who have excelled in the difficult art of portraying characters in
      which no single feature is extravagantly over-charged.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have expounded the law soundly, we can have no difficulty in
      applying it to the particular case before us. Madame D'Arblay has left us
      scarcely anything but humours. Almost every one of her men and women has
      some one propensity developed to a morbid degree. In &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; for
      example, Mr. Delville never opens his lips without some allusion to his
      own birth and station; or Mr. Briggs, without some allusion to the
      hoarding of money; or Mr. Hobson, without betraying the self-indulgence
      and self-importance of a purseproud upstart; or Mr. Simkins, without
      uttering some sneaking remark for the purpose of currying favour with his
      customers; or Mr. Meadows, without expressing apathy and weariness of
      life; or Mr. Albany, without declaiming about the vices of the rich and
      the misery of the poor; or Mrs. Belfield, without some-indelicate eulogy
      on her son; or Lady Margaret, without indicating jealousy of her husband.
      Morrice is all skipping, officious impertinence, Mr. Gosport all sarcasm,
      Lady Honoria all lively prattle, Miss Larolles all silly prattle. If ever
      Madame D'Arblay aimed at more, as in the character of Monckton, we do not
      think that she succeeded well.<a href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26"
       id="linknoteref-26">[26]</a> We are, therefore, forced to refuse to Madame
      D'Arblay a place in the highest rank of art; but we cannot deny that, in
      the rank to which she belonged, she had few equals and scarcely any
      superior. The variety of humours which is to be found in her novels is
      immense; and though the talk of each person separately is monotonous, the
      general effect is not monotony, but a very lively and agreeable diversity.
      Her plots are rudely constructed and improbable, if we consider them in
      themselves. But they are admirably framed for the purpose of exhibiting
      striking groups of eccentric characters, each governed by his own peculiar
      whim, each talking his own peculiar jargon, and each bringing out by
      opposition the oddities of all the rest. We will give one example out of
      many which occur to us. All probability is violated in order to bring Mr.
      Delville, Mr. Briggs, Mr. Hobson, and Mr. Albany into a room together. But
      when we have them there, we soon forget probability in the exquisitely
      ludicrous effect which is produced by the conflict of four old fools, each
      raging with a monomania of his own, each talking a dialect of his own, and
      each inflaming all the others anew every time he opens his mouth. Madame
      D'Arblay was most successful in comedy, and, indeed, in comedy which
      bordered on farce. But we are inclined to infer from some passages, both
      in &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Camilla,&rdquo; that she might have attained equal distinction
      in the pathetic. We have formed this judgment less from those ambitious
      scenes of distress which lie near the catastrophe of each of those novels,
      than from some exquisite strokes of natural tenderness which take us, here
      and there, by surprise. We would mention as examples, Mrs. Hill's account
      of her little boy's death in &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; and the parting of Sir Hugh Tyrold
      and Camilla, when the honest baronet thinks himself dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is melancholy to think that the whole fame of Madame D'Arblay rests on
      what she did during the earlier part of her life, and that everything
      which she published during the forty-three years which preceded her death
      lowered her reputation. Yet we have no reason to think that at the time
      when her faculties ought to have been in their maturity, they were smitten
      with any blight. In &ldquo;The Wanderer,&rdquo; we catch now and then a gleam of her
      genius. Even in the memoirs of her father, there is no trace of dotage.
      They are very bad; but they are so, as it seems to us, not from a decay of
      power, but from a total perversion of power. The truth is, that Madame
      D'Arblay's style underwent a gradual and most pernicious change&mdash;a
      change which, in degree at least, we believe to be unexampled in literary
      history, and of which it may be useful to trace the progress. When she
      wrote her letters to Mr. Crisp, her early journals and her first novel,
      her style was not, indeed, brilliant or energetic; but it was easy, clear,
      and free from all offensive thoughts. When she wrote &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; she aimed
      higher. She had then lived much in a circle of which Johnson was the
      centre; and she was herself one of his most submissive worshippers. It
      seems never to have crossed her mind that the style even of his best
      writings was by no means faultless and that even had it been faultless, it
      might not be wise in her to imitate it. Phraseology which is proper in a
      disquisition on the Unities or in a preface to a dictionary, may be quite
      out of place in a tale of fashionable life. Old gentlemen do not criticise
      the reigning modes, nor do young gentlemen make love, with the balanced
      epithets and sonorous cadences which, on occasions of great dignity, a
      skilful writer may use with happy effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an evil hour the author of &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; took &ldquo;The Rambler&rdquo; for her model.
      This would not have been wise even if she could have imitated her pattern
      as well as Hawkesworth did. But such imitation was beyond her power. She
      had her own style. It was a tolerably good one; and might, without any
      violent change, have been improved into a very good one. She determined to
      throw it away, and to adopt a style in which she could attain excellence
      only by achieving an almost miraculous victory over nature and over habit.
      She could cease to be Fanny Burney; it was not so easy to become Samuel
      Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; the change of manner began to appear. But in &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; the
      imitation of Johnson, though not always in the best taste, is sometimes
      eminently happy; and the passages which are so verbose as to be positively
      offensive, are few. There were people who whispered that Johnson had
      assisted his young friend, and that the novel owed all its finest passages
      to his hand. This was merely the fabrication of envy. Miss Burney's real
      excellences were as much beyond the reach of Johnson as his real
      excellences were beyond her reach, He could no more have written the
      Masquerade scene or the Vauxhall scene, than she could have written the
      life of Cowley or the review of Soame Jenyns. But we have not the smallest
      doubt that he revised &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; and that he re-touched the style of many
      passages.<a href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27">[27]</a>
      We know that he was in the habit of giving assistance of this kind most
      freely. Goldsmith, Hawkesworth, Boswell, Lord Hailes, Mrs. Williams, were
      among those who obtained his help. Nay, he even corrected the poetry of
      Mr. Crabbe, whom, we believe, he had never seen. When Miss Burney thought
      of writing a comedy, he promised to give her his best counsel, though he
      owned that he was not particularly well qualified to advise on matters
      relating to the stage. We therefore think it in the highest degree
      improbable that his little Fanny, when living in habits of the most
      affectionate intercourse with him, would have brought out an important
      work without consulting him; and, when we look into &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; we see such
      traces of his hand in the grave and elevated passages as it is impossible
      to mistake. Before we conclude this article, we will give two or three
      examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next Madame D'Arblay appeared before the world as a writer, she was
      in a very different situation. She would not content herself with the
      simple English in which &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; had been written. She had no longer the
      friend who, we are confident, had polished and strengthened the style of
      &ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo; She had to write in Johnson's manner without Johnson's aid. The
      consequence was, that in &ldquo;Camilla&rdquo; every passage which she meant to be
      fine is detestable; and that the book has been saved from condemnation
      only by the admirable spirit and force of those scenes in which she was
      content to be familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was to be a still deeper descent. After the publication of
      &ldquo;Camilla&rdquo; Madame D'Arblay resided ten years at Paris. During these years
      there was scarcely any intercourse between France and England. It was with
      difficulty that a short letter could occasionally be transmitted. All
      Madame D'Arblay's companions were French. She must have written, spoken,
      thought in French. Ovid expressed his fear that a shorter exile might have
      affected the purity of his Latin. During a shorter exile Gibbon unlearned
      his native English. Madame D'Arblay had carried a bad style to France. She
      brought back a style which we are really at a loss to describe. It is a
      sort of broken Johnsonese, a barbarous, patois, bearing the same relation
      to the language of &ldquo;Rasselas&rdquo; which the gibberish of the negroes of
      Jamaica bears to the English of the House of Lords. Sometimes it reminds
      us of the finest, that is to say the vilest, parts of Mr. Galt's novels;
      sometimes of the perorations of Exeter hall; sometimes of the leading
      articles of the &ldquo;Morning Post.&rdquo; But it most resembles the puffs of Mr.
      Rowland and Dr. Goss. It matters not what ideas are clothed in such a
      style. The genius of Shakspeare and Bacon united would not save a work so
      written from general derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only by means of specimens that we can enable our readers to judge
      how widely Madame D'Arblay's three styles differed from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following passage was written before she became intimate with Johnson.
      It is from &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His son seems weaker in his understanding and more gay in his temper; but
      his gaiety is that of a foolish, overgrown schoolboy, whose mirth consists
      in noise and disturbance. He disdains his father for his close attention
      to business and love of money, though he seems himself to have no talents,
      spirit or generosity to make him superior to either. His chief delight
      appears to be in tormenting and ridiculing his sisters, who in return most
      cordially despise him. Miss Branghton, the eldest daughter, is by no means
      ugly; but looks proud, ill-tempered and conceited. She hates the city,
      though without knowing why; for it is easy to discover she has lived
      nowhere else. Miss Poly Branghton is rather pretty, very foolish, very
      ignorant, very giddy and, I believe, very good natured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is not a fine style, but simple, perspicuous, and agreeable. We now
      come to &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; written during Miss Burney's intimacy with Johnson&mdash;and
      we leave it to our readers to judge whether the following passage was not
      at least corrected by his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather an imaginary than an actual evil and, though a deep wound to
      pride, no offence to morality. Thus have I laid open to you my whole
      heart, confessed my perplexities, acknowledged my vain glory and exposed,
      with equal sincerity, the sources of my doubts and the motives of my
      decision. But now, indeed, how to proceed I know not. The difficulties
      which are yet to encounter I fear to enumerate, and the petition I have to
      urge I have scarce courage to mention. My family, mistaking ambition for
      honour and rank for dignity, have long planned a splendid connection for
      me, to which, though my invariable repugnance has stopped any advances,
      their wishes and their views immoveably adhere. I am but too certain they
      will now listen to no other. I dread, therefore, to make a trial where I
      despair of success. I know not how to risk a prayer with those who may
      silence me by a command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Take now a specimen of Madame D'Arblay's later style. This is the way in
      which she tells us that her father, on his journey back from the
      Continent, caught the rheumatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was assaulted, during his precipitated return, by the rudest
      fierceness of wintry elemental strife; through which, with bad
      accommodations and innumerable accidents, he became a prey to the
      merciless pangs of the acutest spasmodic rheumatism, which barely suffered
      him to reach his home ere long and piteously, it confined him, a tortured
      prisoner, to his bed. Such was the check that almost instantly curbed,
      though it could not subdue, the rising pleasure of his hopes of entering
      upon a new species of existence&mdash;that of an approved man of letters;
      for it was on the bed of sickness, exchanging the light wines of France,
      Italy and Germany, for the black and loathsome potions of the
      Apothecaries' hall, writhed by darting stitches and burning with fiery
      fever, that he felt the full force of that sublunary equipoise that seems
      evermore to hang suspended over the attainment of long-sought and uncommon
      felicity, just as it is ripening to burst forth with enjoyment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here is a second passage from &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Selwyn is very kind and attentive to me. She is extremely clever.
      Her understanding, indeed, may be called masculine; but unfortunately her
      manners deserve the same epithet, for, in studying to acquire the
      knowledge of the other sex, she has lost all the softness of her own. In
      regard to myself, however, as I have neither courage nor inclination to
      argue with her, I have never been personally hurt at her want of
      gentleness&mdash;a virtue which nevertheless seems so essential a part of
      the female character, that I find myself more awkward and less at ease
      with a woman who wants it than I do with a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is a good style of its kind, and the following passage from &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo;
       is also in a good style, though not in a faultless one. We say with
      confidence&mdash;either Sam Johnson or the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the imperious Mr. Delville was more supportable here than in London.
      Secure in his own castle, he looked round him with a pride of power and
      possession which softened while it swelled him. His superiority was
      undisputed: his will was without control. He was not, as in the the great
      capital of the kingdom, surrounded by competitors. No rivalry disturbed
      his peace; no equality mortified his greatness. All he saw were either
      vassals of his power, or guests bending to his pleasure. He abated,
      therefore, considerably the stern gloom of his haughtiness and soothed his
      proud mind by the courtesy of condescension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We will stake our reputation for critical sagacity on this, that no such
      paragraph as that which we have last quoted can be found in any of Madame
      D'Arblay's works except &ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo; Compare with it the following sample of
      her later style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If beneficence be judged by the happiness which it diffuses, whose claim,
      by that proof, shall stand higher than that of Mrs. Montagu, from the
      munificence with which she celebrated her annual festival for those
      hapless Artificers who perform the most abject offices of any authorised
      calling in being the active guardians of our blazing hearths? Not to vain
      glory but to kindness of heart, should be adjudged the publicity of that
      superb charity which made its jetty objects, for one bright morning, cease
      to consider themselves as degraded outcasts from all society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We add one or two short samples. Sheridan refused to permit his lovely
      wife to sing in public, and was warmly praised on this account by Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last of men,&rdquo; says Madame D'Arblay &ldquo;was Dr. Johnson to have abetted
      squandering the delicacy of integrity by nullifying the labours of
      talents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Club, Johnson's Club, did itself no honour by rejecting, on political
      grounds, two distinguished men&mdash;one a Tory, the other a Whig. Madame
      D'Arblay tells the story thus:&mdash;&ldquo;A similar ebullition of political
      rancour with that which so difficultly had been conquered for Mr. Canning
      foamed over the ballot box to the exclusion of Mr. Rogers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An offence punishable with imprisonment is, in this language, an offence
      &ldquo;which produces incarceration.&rdquo; To be starved to death is &ldquo;to sink from
      inanition into nonentity.&rdquo; Sir Isaac Newton is &ldquo;the developer of the skies
      in their embodied movements;&rdquo; and Mrs. Thrale, when a party of clever
      people sat silent, is said to have been &ldquo;provoked by the dullness of a
      Witurnity that, in the midst of such renowned interlocutors, produced as
      narcotic a torpor as could have been caused by a dearth the most barren of
      all human faculties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth it is impossible to look at any page of Madame D'Arblay's later
      works without finding flowers of rhetoric like these. Nothing in the
      language of those jargonists at whom Mr. Gosport laughed, nothing in the
      language of Sir Sedley Clarendel, approaches this new Euphuism.<a
      href="#linknote-28" name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28">[28]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from no unfriendly feeling to Madame D'Arblay's memory that we have
      expressed ourselves, so strongly on the subject of her style. On the
      contrary, we conceive that we have really rendered a service to her
      reputation. That her later works were complete failures is a fact too
      notorious to be dissembled, and some persons, we believe, have
      consequently taken up a notion that she was from the first an overrated
      writer, and that she had not the powers which were necessary to maintain
      her on the eminence on which good luck and fashion had placed her. We
      believe, on the contrary, that her early popularity was no more than the
      just reward of distinguished merit, and would never have undergone an
      eclipse if she had only been content to go on writing in her mother
      tongue. If she failed when she quitted her own province and attempted to
      occupy one in which she had neither part nor lot, this reproach is common
      to her with a crowd of distinguished men. Newton failed when he turned
      from the courses of the stars and the ebb and flow of the ocean to
      apocalyptic seals and vials. Bentley failed when he turned from Homer and
      Aristophanes to edit the &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo; Enigo failed when he attempted
      to rival the Gothic churches of the fourteenth century. Wilkie failed when
      he took it into his head that the &ldquo;Blind Fiddler&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Rent Day&rdquo; were
      unworthy of his powers, and challenged competition with Lawrence as a
      portrait painter. Such failures should be noted for the instruction of
      posterity, but they detract little from the permanent reputation of those
      who have really done great things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one word more. It is not only on account of the intrinsic merit of
      Madame D'Arblay's early works that she is entitled to honourable mention.
      Her appearance is an important epoch in our literary history. &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo;
       was the first tale written by a woman, and purporting to be a picture of
      life and manners, that lived or deserved to live. &ldquo;The Female Quixote&rdquo; is
      no exception. That work has undoubtedly great merit, when considered as a
      wild, satirical harlequinade; but if we consider it as a picture of life
      and manners, we must pronounce it more absurd than any of the romances
      which it was designed to ridicule.<a href="#linknote-29"
       name="linknoteref-29" id="linknoteref-29">[29]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, most of the popular novels which preceded &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; were such as
      no lady would have written; and many of them were such as no lady could
      without confusion own that she had read. The very name of novel was held
      in horror among religious people. In decent families, which did not
      profess extraordinary sanctity, there was a strong feeling against all
      such works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony Absolute, two or three years before &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; appeared, spoke the
      sense of the great body of fathers and husbands when he pronounced the
      circulating library an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledge. This
      feeling on the part of the grave and reflecting increased the evil from
      which it had sprung. The novelist having little character to lose, and
      having few readers among serious people, took without scruple liberties
      which in our generation seem almost incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Burney did for the English novel what Jeremy Collier<a
      href="#linknote-30" name="linknoteref-30" id="linknoteref-30">[30]</a> did
      for the English drama; and she did it in a better way. She first showed
      that a tale might be written in which both the fashionable and the vulgar
      life of London might be exhibited with great force and with broad comic
      humour, and which yet should not contain a single line inconsistent with
      rigid morality or even with virgin delicacy. She took away the reproach
      which lay on a most useful and delightful species of composition. She
      vindicated the right of her sex to an equal share in a fair and noble
      province of letters. Several accomplished women have followed in her
      track. At present, the novels which we owe to English ladies form no small
      part of the literary glory of our Country. No class of works is more
      honourably distinguished by fine observation, by grace, by delicate wit,
      by pure moral feeling. Several among the successors of Madame D'Arblay
      have equalled her; two, we think, have surpassed her. But the fact that
      she has been surpassed gives her an additional claim to our respect and
      gratitude; for, in truth, we owe to her not only &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Camilla,&rdquo; but also &ldquo;Mansfield Park&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Absentee.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY PUBLISHES HER FIRST NOVEL AND FINDS HERSELF FAMOUS.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Miss Burney's first novel, &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; had been submitted in
     manuscript to the great publisher, Dodsley, who refused to
     look at an anonymous work.  It was then offered to Lowndes,
     who published it.  The negotiations with the publisher were
     carried on by Fanny's brother Charles, and her cousin,
     Edward Burney. These two, with her sisters, and her aunts
     Anne and Rebecca (Dr. Burney's sisters), appear to have been
     the only persons entrusted with the secret.  It will be most
     convenient here, at the commencement of&mdash;&ldquo;The Diary,&rdquo; to
     give a few necessary details respecting the Burney family.
     By his first wife, Esther Sleepe, Dr. Burney became the
     father of seven children:&mdash;

     1. Esther (&ldquo;Hetty&rdquo;), born 1749; married, in 1770, her cousin
     Charles Rousseau Burney, eldest son of Dr. Burney's elder
     brother, Richard Burney, of Worcester.  Hetty's husband is
     always called &ldquo;Mr. Burney&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Diary&rdquo;.  He was a
     musician.

     2. James, the sailor, afterwards Admiral Burney, known to
     readers of &ldquo;Elia.&rdquo;  He was born June 5, 1750; accompanied
     the great discoverer, Captain Cook, on his second and third
     voyages; served in the East Indies in 1783, after which he
     retired from active service.  In 1785 he married Miss Sally
     Payne, and the rest of his life was devoted to literature
     and whist.  His &ldquo;History of the Discoveries in the South Sea
     or Pacific Ocean&rdquo; is still a standard work.  James died
     November 17, 1821.

     3. Charles born June, 1751; died young.

     4&mdash;&ldquo;Frances&rdquo; our &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; born June 13, 1752.

     5. Susanna Elizabeth, the &ldquo;peculiar darling of the whole
     house of Dr. Burney, as well as of his heart&rdquo;&mdash;so Fanny
     writes of her favourite sister.  She was born about 1755,
     and married, in the beginning Of 1781, Captain Molesworth
     Phillips, who, as Cook's lieutenant of marines, had seen the
     discoverer murdered by savages, in February, 1779, and
     narrowly escaped with his own life on that occasion.  Susan
     died January 6, 1800.

     6. Charles, afterwards Dr. Charles, the distinguished Greek
     scholar; born December 4, 1757.  After his death, in 1817,
     his magnificent library was purchased for the British
     Museum, at a cost Of 13,500 pounds.

     7. Charlotte Ann, born about 1759.  She married Clement
     Francis, in February, 1786.  He died in 1792, and she
     married again in 1798, Mrs. Barrett, the editress of the
     &ldquo;Diary and Letters of Madame d'Arblay,&rdquo; was Charlotte's
     daughter by her first marriage.

     By his second wife, Elizabeth Allen, whom he married in
     1767, Dr. Burney had two children&mdash;a son, Richard Thomas,
     and a daughter, Sarah Harriet.  The latter followed the
     career of her famous half-sister, and acquired some
     distinction as a novelist. Cousins Richard and Edward were
     younger sons of Uncle Richard Burney, of Worcester.  Edward
     was successful as an artist, especially as a book-
     illustrator.  He painted the portrait of Fanny Burney, a
     reproduction of which forms the frontispiece to the present
     volume.  Some of his work may be seen in the South
     Kensington Museum.

     Chesington, where we shall presently find Fanny on a visit
     to Mr. Crisp, was an old roomy mansion, standing in the
     midst of a lonely common in Surrey, between Kingston and
     Epsom.  It had belonged to Mr. Crisp's friend, Christopher
     Hamilton, and on his death became the property of his
     unmarried sister, Mrs. Sarah Hamilton, who, being in poor
     circumstances, let part of the house to a farmer, and took
     boarders.  Of the latter, Mr. Crisp was the most constant,
     boarding at Chesington for nearly twenty years, and dying
     there in 1783.  Kitty Cooke, whose name occurs in the
     &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; was the niece of Mrs. Hamilton, and resided with
     her at Chesington.  Mrs. Sophia Gast, whom we find a
     frequent visitor there, was the sister of Mr. Crisp, and
     resided at Burford, in Oxfordshire.

     Chesington Hall, the name the old manor house goes by in the
     locality, is still standing, and is a plain brick building
     with a small bell turret in the roof, but in other respects
     it has been somewhat modernized since the days of Fanny
     Burney.  The common has been parcelled out into fields, and
     a picturesque country road now gives access to the front
     entrance to the house.  From the lawn at the back a narrow
     avenue of venerable trees, which throw out their long arms
     in strange grotesque fashion, leads directly to the little
     village church where Mr. Crisp is buried.&mdash;ED.]

    <h2>
      &ldquo;EVELINA&rdquo; AND THE MYSTERY ATTENDING ITS PUBLICATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This year was ushered in by a grand and most important event! At the
      latter end of January, the literary world was favoured with the first
      publication of the ingenious, learned, and most profound Fanny Burney! I
      doubt not but this memorable affair will, in future times, mark the period
      whence chronologers will date the zenith of the polite arts in this
      island!
    </p>
    <p>
      This admirable authoress has named her most elaborate performance,
      &ldquo;Evelina; or, a Young Lady's Entrance into the World.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this may seem a rather bold attempt and title, for a female whose
      knowledge of the world is very confined, and whose inclinations, as well
      as situation, incline her to a private and domestic life. All I can urge
      is, that I have only presumed to trace the accidents and adventures to
      which a &ldquo;young woman&rdquo; is liable; I have not pretended to show the world
      what it actually is, but what it appears to a girl of seventeen, and so
      far as that, surely any girl who is past seventeen may safely do? The
      motto of my excuse shall be taken from Pope's &ldquo;Temple of Fame &ldquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In every work regard the writer's end
     None e'er can compass more than they intend.

    <p>
      About the middle of January, my cousin Edward brought me a parcel, under
      the name of Grafton. I had, some little time before, acquainted both my
      aunts of my frolic. They will, I am sure, be discreet; indeed, I exacted a
      vow from them Of strict secrecy; and they love me with such partial
      kindness, that I have a pleasure in reposing much confidence in them. I
      immediately conjectured what the parcel was, and found the following
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleet-street, Jan. 7, 1778.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      I take the liberty to send you a novel, which a gentleman, your
      acquaintance, said you would hand to him. I beg with expedition, as 'tis
      time it should be published, and 'tis requisite he first revise it, or the
      reviewers may find a flaw.&mdash;I am, sir, your obedient servant, Thomas
      Lowndes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. Grafton,
    </p>
    <p>
      To be left at the Orange Coffee-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunts, now, would take no denial to my reading it to them, in order to
      mark errata; and to cut the matter short, I was compelled to communicate
      the affair to my cousin Edward, and then to obey their commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, they were all prodigiously charmed with it. My cousin now
      became my agent, as deputy to Charles, with Mr. Lowndes, and when I had
      made the errata, carried it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book, however, was not published till the latter end of the month. A
      thousand little odd incidents happened about this time, but I am not in a
      humour to recollect them; however, they were none of them productive of a
      discovery either to my father or mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      My little book, I am told, is now at all the circulating libraries. I have
      an exceeding odd sensation, when I consider that it is now in the power of
      any and every body to read what I so carefully hoarded even from my best
      friends, till this last month or two; and that a work which was so lately
      lodged, in all privacy, in my bureau, may now be seen by every butcher and
      baker, cobbler and tinker, throughout the three kingdoms, for the small
      tribute of threepence.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Anne and Miss Humphries being settled at this time at Brompton, I
      was going thither with Susan to tea, when Charlotte acquainted me that
      they were then employed in reading &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; to the invalid, my cousin
      Richard. My sister had recommended it to Miss Humphries, and my aunts and
      Edward agreed that they would read it, but without mentioning anything of
      the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      This intelligence gave me the utmost uneasiness&mdash;I foresaw a thousand
      dangers of a discovery&mdash;I dreaded the indiscreet warmth of all my
      confidants. In truth, I was quite sick with apprehension, and was too
      uncomfortable to go to Brompton, and Susan carried my excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon her return, I was somewhat tranquillised, for she assured me that
      there was not the smallest suspicion of the author, and that they had
      concluded it to be the work of a man! and Miss Humphries, who read it
      aloud to Richard said several things in its commendation, and concluded
      them by exclaiming, &ldquo;It's a thousand pities the author should lie
      concealed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding myself more safe than I had apprehended, I ventured to go to
      Brompton next day. In my way up-stairs, I heard Miss Humphries in the
      midst of Mr. Villars' letter of consolation upon Sir John Belmont's
      rejection of his daughter; and just as I entered the room, she cried out,
      &ldquo;How pretty that is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How much in luck would she have thought herself, had she known who heard
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a private confabulation which I had with my aunt Anne, she told me a
      thousand things that had been said in its praise, and assured me they had
      not for a moment doubted that the work was a man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comforted and made easy by these assurances, I longed for the diversion of
      hearing their observations, and therefore (though rather mal a propos)
      after I had been near two hours in the room, I told Miss Humphries that I
      was afraid I had interrupted her, and begged she would go on with what she
      was reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried she, taking up the book, &ldquo;we have been prodigiously
      entertained;&rdquo; and very readily she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must own I suffered great difficulty in refraining from laughing upon
      several occasions, and several times, when they praised what they read, I
      was upon the point of saying, &ldquo;You are very good!&rdquo; and so forth, and I
      could scarcely keep myself from making acknowledgments, and bowing my head
      involuntarily. However, I got off perfectly safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Susan and I went to tea at Brompton. We met Miss
      Humphries coming to town. She told us she had just finished &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; and
      gave us to understand that she could not get away till she had done it. We
      heard afterwards from my aunt the most flattering praises; and Richard
      could talk Of nothing else. His encomiums gave me double pleasure, from
      being wholly unexpected: for I had prepared myself to hear that he held it
      extremely cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems, to my utter amazement, Miss Humphries has guessed the author to
      be Anstey, who wrote the &ldquo;Bath Guide&rdquo;! How improbable and how
      extraordinary a supposition! But they have both of them done it so much
      honour that, but for Richard's anger at Evelina's bashfulness, I never
      Could believe they did not suspect me. I never went to Brompton without
      finding the third volume in Richard's hands; he speaks of all the
      characters as if they were his acquaintance, and Praises different parts
      perpetually: both he and Miss Humphries seem to have it by heart, for it
      is always a propos to Whatever is the subject of discourse, and their
      whole conversation almost consists of quotations from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Chesington, June 18.</i>&mdash;I came hither the first week in May. My
      recovery from that time to this, has been slow and sure; but as I could
      walk hardly three yards in a day at first, I found so much time to spare,
      that I could not resist treating myself with a little private sport with
      &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; a young lady whom I think I have some right to make free with.
      I had promised Hetty that she should read it to Mr. Crisp, at her own
      particular request; but I wrote my excuses, and introduced it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him it was a book which Hetty had taken to Brompton, to divert my
      cousin Richard during his confinement. He was so indifferent about it,
      that I thought he would not give himself the trouble to read it, and often
      embarrassed me by unlucky questions, such as, &ldquo;If it was reckoned clever?&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;What I thought of it?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whether folks laughed at it?&rdquo; I always
      evaded any direct or satisfactory answer; but he was so totally free from
      any idea of suspicion, that my perplexity escaped his notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, he desired me to begin reading to him. I dared not trust my
      voice with the little introductory ode, for as that is no romance, but the
      sincere effusion of my heart, I could as soon read aloud my own letters,
      written in my own name and character: I therefore skipped it, and have so
      kept the book out of his sight, that, to this day, he knows not it is
      there. Indeed, I have, since, heartily repented that I read any of the
      book to him, for I found it a much more awkward thing than I had expected:
      my voice quite faltered when I began it, which, however, I passed off for
      the effect of remaining weakness of lungs; and, in short, from an
      invincible embarrassment, which I could not for a page together repress,
      the book, by my reading, lost all manner of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, though he has by no means treated it with the praise so
      lavishly bestowed upon it from other quarters, I had the satisfaction to
      observe that he was even greedily eager to go on with it; so that I
      flatter myself the story caught his attention: and, indeed, allowing for
      my mauling reading, he gave it quite as much credit as I had any reason to
      expect. But, now that I was sensible of my error in being 'my own mistress
      of the ceremonies, I determined to leave to Hetty the third volume, and
      therefore pretended I had not brought it. He was in a delightful ill
      humour about it, and I enjoyed his impatience far more than I should have
      done his forbearance. Hetty, therefore, when she comes, has undertaken to
      bring it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had a visit from my beloved Susy, who, with my mother<a
      href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31" id="linknoteref-31">[31]</a> and
      little Sally,<a href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32"
       id="linknoteref-32">[32]</a> spent a day here, to my no small
      satisfaction; and yet I was put into an embarrassment, of which I even yet
      know not what will be the end, during their short stay: for Mr. Crisp,
      before my mother, very innocently said, &ldquo;O! Susan, pray Susette, do send
      me the third volume of &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo;; Fanny brought me the two first on
      purpose, I believe, to tantalize me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt myself in a ferment; and Susan, too, looked foolish, and knew not
      what to answer. As I sat on the same sofa with him, I gave him a gentle
      shove, as a token, which he could not but understand, that he had said
      something wrong&mdash;though I believe he could not imagine what. Indeed,
      how should he?
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother instantly darted forward, and repeated &ldquo;Evelina,&mdash;what's
      that, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I jolted Mr. Crisp, who, very much perplexed, said, in a boggling
      manner, that it was a novel&mdash;he supposed from the circulating library&mdash;only
      a &ldquo;trumpery novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, my dear daddy! thought I, you would have devised some other sort of
      speech, if you knew all! But he was really, as he well might be, quite at
      a loss for what I wanted him to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had it here, then, have you?&rdquo; continued my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;two of the volumes,&rdquo; said Mr. Crisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, had you them from the library?&rdquo; asked my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; answered I, horribly frightened, &ldquo;from my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, the books are Susan's, who bought them the first day of
      publication; but I did not dare own that, as it would have been almost an
      acknowledgment of all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked some further questions, to which we made the same sort of
      answers, and then the matter dropped. Whether it rests upon her mind, or
      not, I cannot tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after, I received from Charlotte a letter the most interesting
      that could be written to me, for it acquainted me that My dear father was,
      at length, reading my book, which has now been published six months. How
      this has come to pass, I am yet in the dark; but, it seems, that the very
      Moment almost that my mother and Susan and Sally left the house, he
      desired Charlotte to bring him the &ldquo;Monthly Review;&rdquo; she contrived to look
      over his shoulder as he opened it, which he did at the account of
      &ldquo;Evelina; Or, a Young Lady's Entrance into the World.&rdquo; He read it with
      great earnestness, then put it down; and presently after snatched it up,
      and read it again. Doubtless, his paternal heart felt some agitation for
      his girl, in reading a review of her publication!<a href="#linknote-33"
       name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33">[33]</a>&mdash;how he got at the
      name, I cannot imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after he turned to Charlotte, and bidding her come close to him, he
      put his finger on the word &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; and saying, she knew what it was,
      bade her&mdash;write down the name, and send the man to Lowndes, as if for
      herself. This she did, and away went William.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then told Charlotte, that he had never known the name of it till the
      day before. 'Tis strange how he got at it! He added that I had come off
      vastly well in this review, except for &ldquo;the Captain.&rdquo; Charlotte told him
      it had also been in &ldquo;Kenrick's review,"<a href="#linknote-34"
       name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34">[34]</a> and he desired her to
      copy out for him what was said in both of them. He asked her, too, whether
      I had mentioned the work was by a lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      When William returned, he took the books from him, and the moment he was
      gone, opened the first volume&mdash;and opened it upon the Ode! How great
      must have been his astonishment, at seeing himself so addressed!<a
      href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35" id="linknoteref-35">[35]</a>
      Indeed, Charlotte says he looked all amazement, read a line or two with
      great eagerness, and then, stopping short, he seemed quite affected, and
      the tears started into his eyes: dear soul! I am sure they did into mine,
      nay, I even sobbed, as I read the account.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe he was obliged to go out before he advanced much further. But
      the next day I had a letter from Susan, in which I heard that he had begun
      reading it with Lady Hales, and Miss Coussmaker, and that they liked it
      vastly!<a href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36" id="linknoteref-36">[36]</a>
      Lady Hales spoke of it very innocently, in the highest terms, declaring
      she was sure it was written by somebody in high life, And that it had all
      the marks of real genius! She added, &ldquo;he must be a man of great
      abilities!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How ridiculous! but Miss Coussmaker was a little nearer the truth, for she
      gave it as her opinion, that the writer was a woman, for she said there
      was such a remarkable delicacy in the conversations and descriptions,
      notwithstanding the grossness and vulgarity of some of the characters, and
      that all oaths and indelicate words were so carefully, yet naturally
      avoided, that she could not but suspect the writer was a female; but, she
      added, notwithstanding the preface declared that the writer never would be
      known, she hoped, if the book circulated as she expected it would, he or
      she would be tempted to make a discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ha! ha! ha!-that's my answer. They little think how well they are already
      acquainted with the writer they so much honour! Susan begged to have,
      then, my father's real and final opinion;&mdash;and it is such that I
      almost blush to write, even for my own private reading; but yet is such as
      I can by no means suffer to pass unrecorded, as my whole journal contains
      nothing so grateful to me. I will copy his own words, according to Susan's
      solemn declaration of their authenticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word I think it the best novel I know, except Fielding's, and, in
      some respects, better than his! I have been excessively pleased with it;
      there are, perhaps a few things that might have been otherwise. Mirvan's
      trick upon Lovel is, I think, carried too far,&mdash;there is something
      even disgusting in it: however, this instance excepted, I protest I think
      it will scarce bear an improvement. The language is as good as anybody
      need write&mdash;I declare, as good as I would wish to read. Lord
      Orville's character is just what it should be&mdash;-perfectly benevolent
      and upright; and there is a boldness in it that struck me mightily, for he
      is a man not ashamed of being better than the rest of mankind. Evelina is
      in a new style too, so perfectly innocent and natural; and the scene
      between her and her father, Sir John Belmont, is a scene for a tragedy! I
      blubbered at it, and Lady Hales and Miss Coussmaker are not yet recovered
      from hearing it, it made them quite ill: indeed, it is wrought up in a
      most extraordinary manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This account delighted me more than I&mdash;can express. How little did I
      dream of ever being so much honoured! But the approbation of all the world
      put together, would not bear any competition, in my estimation, with that
      of my beloved father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>July 25.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Cholmondeley has been reading and praising
      &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; and my father Is quite delighted at her approbation, and told
      Susan that I could not have had a greater compliment than making two such
      women my friends as Mrs. Thrale<a href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37"
       id="linknoteref-37">[37]</a> and Mrs. Cholmondeley, for they were severe
      and knowing, and afraid of praising a tort et a travers, as their opinions
      are liable to be quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale said she had only to complain it was too short. She
      recommended it to my mother to read!&mdash;how droll!&mdash;and she told
      her she would be much entertained with it, for there was a great deal of
      human life in it, and of the manners of the present times, and added that
      it was written &ldquo;by somebody who knows the top and the bottom, the highest
      and the lowest of mankind.&rdquo; She has even lent her set to my mother, who
      brought it home with her!
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, I have again resumed my correspondence with my friend Mr.
      Lowndes. When I sent the errata I desired to have a set directed to Mr.
      Grafton, at the Orange Coffee-house, for I had no copy but the one he sent
      me to make the errata from, which Was incomplete and unbound. However, I
      heard nothing at all from him; and therefore, after some consideration,
      and much demure I determined to make an attempt once more; for my father
      told me it was a shame that I, the author, should not have even one set of
      my own work; I ought, he said, to have had six: and indeed, he is often
      enraged that Lowndes gave no more for the MS.&mdash;but I was satisfied,&mdash;and
      that sufficed.<a href="#linknote-38" name="linknoteref-38"
       id="linknoteref-38">[38]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I therefore wrote him word, that I supposed, in the hurry of his business,
      and variety of his concerns, he had forgotten my request, which I now
      repeated. I also added, that if ever the book went through another
      edition, I should be glad to have timely notice, as I had some corrections
      and alterations to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received an immediate answer, and intelligence from my sisters, that he
      had sent a set of &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; most elegantly bound. The answer I will copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleet-street, July 2, 1778.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;I bound up a set for you the first day I had them, and hoped by
      some means to hear from you. The Great World send hereto buy &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo; A
      polite lady said, Do, Mr. Lowndes, give me &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; I am treated as
      unfashionable for not having read it. I think the impression will be sold
      by Christmas. If meantime, or about that time, you favour me with any
      commands, I shall be proud to observe them. Your obliged servant, J.
      Lowndes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. Grafton.

    <p>
      Chesington, Sunday, July 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your letter, my dearest Susan, and the inclosed one from Lovirrides, have
      flung me into such a vehement perturbation, that I hardly can tell whether
      I wake or dream, and it is even with difficulty that I can fetch my
      breath. I have been strolling round the garden three or four times, in
      hopes of regaining a little quietness. However, I am not very angry at my
      inward disturbance, though it even exceeds what I experienced from the
      &ldquo;Monthly Review.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My dear Susy, what a wonderful affair has this been, and how extraordinary
      is this torrent of success, which sweeps down all before it! I often think
      it too much, nay, almost wish it would happen to some other person, who
      had more ambition, whose hopes were more sanguine, and who could less have
      borne to be buried in the oblivion which I even sought. But though it
      might have been better bestowed, it could by no one be more gratefully
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed I can't help being grave upon the subject; for a success so really
      unexpected almost overpowers me. I wonder at myself that my spirits are
      not more elated. I believe half the flattery I have had would have made me
      madly merry; but all serves only to almost depress me by the fullness of
      heart it occasions. I have been serving Daddy Crisp a pretty trick this
      morning How he would rail if he found it all out! I had a fancy to dive
      pretty deeply into the real rank in which he held my book; so I told him
      that your last letter acquainted me who was reported to be the author of
      &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo; I added that it was a profound secret, and he must by no means
      mention it to a human being. He bid me tell him directly, according to his
      usual style of command&mdash;but I insisted upon his guessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't guess,&rdquo; said he&mdash;-&ldquo;may be it is you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Odd so! thought I, what do you mean by that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, nonsense!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;what should make you think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you look guilty,&rdquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a horrible home stroke. Deuce take my looks! thought I&mdash;I
      shall owe them a grudge for this! however I found it was a mere random
      shot, and, without much difficulty, I laughed it to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who do you think he guessed next?&mdash;My father!&mdash;there's for
      you!&mdash;and several questions he asked me, whether he had lately been
      shut up much-and so on. And this was not all&mdash;for he afterwards
      guessed Mrs. Thrale and Mrs. Greville.<a href="#linknote-39"
       name="linknoteref-39" id="linknoteref-39">[39]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There's honour and glory for you!&mdash;I assure you I grinned
      prodigiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>July 20.</i>&mdash;I have had a letter from Susan. She informs me that
      my father, when he took the books back to Streatham, actually acquainted
      Mrs. Thrale with my secret. He took an opportunity, when they were alone
      together, of saying that Upon her recommendation, he had himself, as well
      as my mother; been reading &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;and is it not a very pretty book? and a Very clever
      book? and a very comical book?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;'tis well enough; but I have something to tell you
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? what?&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;has Mrs. Cholmondeley found out the author?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;not that I know of, but I believe I have, though but
      very lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, pray let's hear!&rdquo; cried she, eagerly, &ldquo;I want to know him of all
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How my father must laugh at the him!&mdash;He then, however, undeceived
      her in regard to that particular, by telling her it was &ldquo;our Fanny!&rdquo; for
      she knows all about our family, as my father talks to her of his domestic
      concerns without any reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred handsome things, of course, followed; and she afterwards read
      some of the comic parts to Dr. Johnson, Mr. Thrale, and whoever came near
      her. How I should have quivered had I been there! but they tell me that
      Dr. Johnson laughed as heartily as my father himself did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more ridiculous than the scenes in which I am almost
      perpetually engaged. Mr. Crisp, who is totally without suspicion, says,
      almost daily, something that has double the meaning he intends to convey;
      for, as I am often writing, either letters, Italian, or some of my own
      vagaries, he commonly calls me the scribe, and the authoress; asks when I
      shall print; says he will have all my works on royal paper, etc.; and the
      other day, Mrs. Gast, who frequently lectures me about studying too hard,
      and injuring my health, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Miss Burney, now you write so much, when do you intend to publish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Publish?&rdquo; cried Mr. Crisp, &ldquo;why, she has published; she brought out a
      book the other day that has made a great noise 'Evelina'&mdash;and she
      bribed the reviewers to speak well of it, and set it a going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was almost ready to run out of the room; but, though the hit was so
      palpable in regard to the book, what he said of the reviewers was so much
      the contrary that it checked my alarm: indeed, had he the most remote idea
      of the truth, he would be the last man to have hinted at it before a room
      full of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried I, as composedly as I could, &ldquo;that is but a small part of my
      authorship&mdash;I shall give you a list of my folios soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had all some jocularity upon the occasion, but I found I was
      perfectly safe; indeed my best security is, that my daddy concludes the
      author to be a man, and all the rest follow as he leads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burney,<a href="#linknote-40" name="linknoteref-40" id="linknoteref-40">[40]</a>
      yesterday, after dinner, said&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen and ladies, I'll propose a
      toast&rdquo;; then filling his glass, he drank &ldquo;to The author of 'Evelina'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had they known the author was present, they could not have more civilly
      accepted the toast; it was a bold kind of drollery in Mr. Burney, for I
      was fain to drink my own health in a bumper, which he filled for me,
      laughing heartily himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>August 3</i>&mdash;I have an immensity to write. Susan has copied me a
      letter which Mrs. Thrale has written to my father, upon the occasion of
      returning my mother two novels by Madame Riccoboni.<a href="#linknote-41"
       name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41">[41]</a> It is so honourable to
      me, and so sweet in her, that I must COPY it for my faithful journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streatham, July 22.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      I forgot to give you the novels in your carriage, which I now send.
      &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; certainly excels them far enough, both in probability of story,
      elegance of sentiment, and general power over the mind, whether exerted in
      humour or pathos; add to this, that Riccoboni is a veteran author, and all
      she ever can be; but I cannot tell what might not be expected from
      &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; were she to try her genius at comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far had I written of my letter, when Mr. Johnson returned home, full of
      the praises of the book I had lent him, and protesting there Were passages
      in it which Might do honour to Richardson. We talk of it for ever, and he
      feels ardent after the d'enouement; hee &ldquo;could not get rid of the rogue,&rdquo;
       he said. I lent him the second volume, and he is now busy with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must be more a philosopher, and less a father, than I wish you, not to
      be pleased with this letter; and the giving such pleasure yields to
      nothing but receiving it. Long, my dear sir, may you live to enjoy the
      just praises of your children! and long may they live to deserve and
      delight such a parent! These are things that you would say in verse&mdash;-but
      poetry implies fiction, and all this is naked truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My compliments to Mrs. Burney, and kindest wishes to all your flock, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, sweet, how amiable in this charming woman is her desire of making my
      dear father satisfied with his scribbler's attempt! I do, indeed, feel the
      most grateful love for her. But Dr. Johnson's approbation!&mdash;It almost
      crazed me with agreeable surprise&mdash;it gave me such a flight of
      spirits that I danced a jig to Mr. Crisp, Without any preparation, music,
      or explanation;&mdash;to his no small amazement and diversion. I left him,
      however, to make his own comments upon my friskiness without affording him
      the smallest assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan also writes me word, that when my father went last to Streatham, Dr.
      Johnson was not there, but Mrs. Thrale told him, that when he gave her the
      first volume of &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; which she had lent him, he said, &ldquo;Why, madam,
      why, what a charming book you lent me!&rdquo; and eagerly inquired for the rest.
      He was particularly pleased with the Snow-hill scenes, and said that Mr.
      Smith's vulgar gentility was admirably portrayed; and when Sir Clement
      joins them, he said there was a shade of character prodigiously well
      marked. Well may it be said, that the greatest winds are ever the most
      candid to the inferior set! I think I should love Dr. Johnson for such
      lenity to a poor mere worm in literature, even if I were not myself the
      identical grub he has obliged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now come to last Saturday evening, when my beloved father came to
      Chesington, in full health, charming spirits, and all kindness, openness,
      and entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his way hither he had stopped at Streatham, and he settled with Mrs.
      Thrale that he would call on her again in his way to town, and carry me
      with him! and Mrs. Thrale said, &ldquo;We all long to know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have been in a kind of twitter ever since, for there seems something
      very formidable in the idea of appearing as an authoress! I ever dreaded
      it, as it is a title which must raise more expectations than I have any
      chance of answering. Yet I am highly flattered by her invitation, and
      highly delighted in the prospect of being introduced to the Streatham
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent me some very serious advice to write for the theatre, as, she
      says, I so naturally run into conversations, that &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; absolutely and
      plainly points out that path to me; and she hinted how much she should be
      pleased to be &ldquo;honoured with my confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My dear father communicated this intelligence, and a great deal more, with
      a pleasure that almost surpassed that with which I heard it, and he seems
      quite eager for me to make another attempt. He desired to take upon
      himself the communication to my daddy Crisp, and as it is now in so many
      hands that it is possible accident might discover it to him, I readily
      consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday evening, as I was going into my father's room, I heard him say,
      &ldquo;The variety of characters&mdash;the variety of scenes&mdash;and the
      language&mdash;why, she has had very little education but what she has
      given herself,-less than any of the others!&rdquo; and Mr. Crisp exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&mdash;it's wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I now found what was going forward, and therefore deemed it most fitting
      to decamp. About an hour after, as I was passing through the hall, I met
      my daddy (Crisp). His face was all animation and archness; he doubled his
      fist at me, and would have stopped me, but I ran past him into the
      parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before supper, however, I again met him, and he would not suffer me to
      escape; he caught both my hands, and looked as if he would have looked me
      through, and then exclaimed, &ldquo;Why you little hussy,&mdash;you young devil!&mdash;an't
      you ashamed to look me in the face, you Evelina, you! Why, what a dance
      have you led me about it! Young friend, indeed! O you little hussy, what
      tricks have you served me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to allow of his running on with these gentle appellations
      for I know not how long, ere he could sufficiently compose himself after
      his great surprise, to ask or hear any particulars&mdash;and then, he
      broke out every three instants with exclamations of astonishment at how I
      had found time to write so much unsuspected, and how and where I had
      picked up such various materials; and not a few times did he, with me, as
      he had with my father, exclaim, &ldquo;wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He has, since, made me read him all my letters upon this subject. He said
      Lowndes would have made an estate had he given me one thousand pounds for
      it, and that he ought not to have given me less. &ldquo;You have nothing to do
      now,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;but to take your pen in hand, for your fame and
      reputation are made, and any bookseller will snap at what you write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then told him that I could not but really and unaffectedly regret that
      the affair was spread to Mrs. Williams and her friends.<a
      href="#linknote-42" name="linknoteref-42" id="linknoteref-42">[42]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if those who are proper judges think it right, that it
      should be known, why should you trouble yourself about it? You have not
      spread it, there can be no imputation of vanity fall to your share, and it
      cannot come out more to your honour than through such a channel as Mrs.
      Thrale.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A FIRST VISIT TO MRS. THRALE AND AN INTRODUCTION To DR. JOHNSON.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [An introduction to Mrs. Thrale was practically an
     introduction into the most brilliant literary circle of the
     day.  Literary lions of all sizes, from the monarch Johnson
     downwards, were wont to resort to Streatham, to eat Thrale's
     dinners, and to enjoy the conversation of his lively wife.
     At Streatham Dr. Burney had been a welcome guest since 1776,
     when he commenced his intimacy with the family by giving
     music lessons to the eldest daughter, Hester Thrale
     (Johnson's &ldquo;Queenie&rdquo;).  The head of the house, Henry Thrale,
     the wealthy brewer and member of Parliament for Southwark,
     was a sensible, unassuming man, whom Johnson loved and
     esteemed, and who returned Johnson's attachment with the
     sincerest regard.  His acquirements, in Johnson's opinion
     were of a far more solid character than those Of his wife,
     whose wit and vivacity, however, gave her more distinction
     in those brilliant assemblies to which Fanny is now, for the
     first time, to be introduced.  Mrs. Thrale was in her
     thirty-eighth year at the date of Fanny's first visit.&mdash;ED.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>August.</i>&mdash;I have now to write an account of the most
      consequential day I have spent since my birth: namely, my visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our journey to Streatham, was the least pleasant part of the day, for the
      roads were dreadfully dusty, and I was really in the fidgets from thinking
      what my reception might be, and from fearing they would expect a less
      awkward and backward kind of person than I was sure they would find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thrale's house is white, and very pleasantly situated, in a fine
      paddock. Mrs. Thrale was strolling about, and came to us as we got out of
      the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I hear Dr. Burney's voice! and you have brought your
      daughter?&mdash;well, now you are good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then received me, taking both my hands, and with mixed politeness and
      cordiality welcoming me to Streatham. She led me into the house, and
      addressed herself almost wholly for a few minutes to my father, as if to
      give me an assurance she did not mean to regard me as a show, or to
      distress or frighten me by drawing me out. Afterwards she took me
      upstairs, and showed me the house, and said she had very much wished to
      see me at Streatham, and should always think herself much obliged to Dr.
      Burney for his goodness in bringing me, which she looked upon as a very
      great favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though we were some time together, and though she was so very civil,
      she did not hint at my book, and I love her much more than ever for her
      delicacy in avoiding a subject which she could not but see would have
      greatly embarrassed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we returned to the music-room, we found Miss Thrale was with my
      father. Miss Thrale is a very fine girl, about fourteen years of age, but
      cold and reserved, though full of knowledge and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, Mrs. Thrale took me to the library; she talked a little while
      upon common topics, and then, at last, she mentioned &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday at supper,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we talked it all over, and discussed all
      your characters&mdash;but Dr. Johnson's favourite is Mr. Smith. He
      declares the fine gentleman manqué was never better drawn; and he acted
      him all the evening, saying he was 'all for the ladies!' He repeated whole
      scenes by heart. I declare I was astonished at him. O, you can't imagine
      how much he is pleased with the book; he 'could not get rid of the rogue,'
      he told me. But was it not droll,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I should recommend it
      to Dr. Burney? and tease him, so innocently, to read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I now prevailed upon Mrs. Thrale to let me amuse myself, and she went to
      dress. I then prowled about to choose some book and I saw upon the
      reading-table, &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;&mdash;I had just fixed upon a new translation of
      Cicero's &ldquo;Laelius,&rdquo; when the library-door was opened, and Mr. Seward<a
      href="#linknote-43" name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43">[43]</a>
      entered. I instantly put away my book, because I dreaded being thought
      studious and affected. He offered his service to find anything for me, and
      then, in the same breath, ran on to speak of the work with which I had
      myself 'favoured the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact words he began with I cannot recollect, for I was actually
      confounded by the attack; and his abrupt manner of letting me know he was
      au fait equally astonished and provoked me. How different from the
      delicacy of Mr. and Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were summoned to dinner, Mrs. Thrale made my father and me sit on
      each side of her. I said that I hoped I did not take Dr. Johnson's place;&mdash;for
      he had not yet appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;he will sit by you, which I am sure will give
      him great pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after we were seated, this great man entered. I have so true a
      veneration for him, that the very sight of him inspires me with delight
      and reverence, notwithstanding the cruel infirmities to which he is
      subject; for he has almost perpetual convulsive movements, either of his
      hands, lips, feet, or knees, and sometimes of all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale introduced me to him, and he took his place. We had a noble
      dinner, and a most elegant dessert. Dr. Johnson, in the middle of dinner,
      asked Mrs. Thrale what were some little pies that were near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mutton,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;so I don't ask you to eat any, because I know you
      despise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, no,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I despise nothing that is so good of its sort;
      but I am too proud now to eat of it. Sitting by Miss Burney makes me very
      proud to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, laughing, &ldquo;you must take care of your
      heart if Dr. Johnson attacks it for I assure you he is not often
      successless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you say, madam?&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;are you making mischief between
      the young lady and me already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little while after he drank Miss Thrale's health and mine, and then
      added: &ldquo;Tis a terrible thing that we cannot wish young ladies well,
      without wishing them to become old women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But some people,&rdquo; said Mr. Seward, &ldquo;are old and young at the same time,
      for they wear so well that they never look old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, no,&rdquo; cried the doctor, laughing; &ldquo;that never yet was; you might
      as well say they are at the same time tall and short. I remember an
      epitaph to that purpose, which is in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (I have quite forgot what,&mdash;and also the name it was made upon, but
      the rest I recollect exactly:)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;lies buried here;
     So early wise, so lasting fair,
     That none, unless her years you told,
     Thought her a child, or thought her old.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We left Streatham at about eight o'clock, and Mr. Seward, who handed me
      into the chaise, added his interest to the rest, that my father would not
      fail to bring me next week. In short I was loaded with civilities from
      them all. And my ride home was equally happy with the rest of the day, for
      my kind and most beloved father was so happy in my happiness, and
      congratulated me so sweetly, that he could, like myself, think on no other
      subject: and he told me that, after passing through such a house as that,
      I could have nothing to fear&mdash;meaning for my book, my honoured book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet my honours stopped not here; for Hetty, who, with her sposo, was here
      to receive us, told me she had lately met Mrs. Reynolds,<a
      href="#linknote-44" name="linknoteref-44" id="linknoteref-44">[44]</a>
      sister of Sir Joshua; and that she talked very much and very highly of a
      new novel called &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo;; though without a shadow of suspicion as to the
      scribbler; and not contented with her own praise, she said that Sir
      Joshua, who began it one day when he was too much engaged to go on with
      it, was so much caught, that he could think of nothing else, and was quite
      absent all the day, not knowing a word that was said to him: and, when he
      took it up again, found himself so much interested in it, that he sat up
      all night to finish it! Sir Joshua, it seems, vows he would give fifty
      pounds to know the author! I have also heard, by the means of Charles,<a
      href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45" id="linknoteref-45">[45]</a>
      that other persons have declared they will find him out!

    <h2>
      FANNY BURNEY INTERVIEWS HER PUBLISHER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This intelligence determined me upon going myself to Mr. Lowndes, and
      discovering what sort of answers he made to such curious inquirers as I
      found were likely to address him. But as I did not dare trust myself to
      speak, for I felt that I should not be able to act my part well, I asked
      my mother to accompany me. We introduced ourselves by buying the book, for
      which I had a commission from Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;. Fortunately Mr.
      Lowndes himself was in the shop; as we found by his air of consequence and
      authority, as well as his age; for I never saw him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had given my mother the book, she asked him if he could tell
      her who wrote it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I don't know myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho, pho,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you mayn't choose to tell, but you must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't indeed, ma'am,&rdquo; answered he &ldquo;I have no honour in keeping the
      secret, for I have never been trusted. All I know of the matter is, that
      it is a gentleman of the other end of the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MY mother made a thousand other inquiries, to which his answers were to
      the following effect: that for a great while, he did not know if it was a
      man or a woman; but now, he knew that much, and that he was a master of
      his subject, and well versed in the manners of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some time,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I thought it had been Horace Walpole's;
      for he once published a book in this snug manner; but I don't think it is
      now. I have often people come to inquire of me who it is; but I suppose he
      will come Out soon, and then when the rest of the world knows it, I shall.
      Servants often come for it from the other end of the town, and I have
      asked them divers questions myself, to see if I could get at the author
      but I never got any satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just before we came away, upon my mother's still further pressing him, he
      said, with a most important face,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, madam, I have been informed that it is a
      piece of real secret history; and, in that case, it will never be known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for me&mdash;-I grinned irresistibly, and was obliged to
      look out at the shop-door till we came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many ridiculous things have I heard upon this subject! I hope that
      next, some particular family will be fixed upon, to whom this secret
      history must belong! However, I am delighted to find myself so safe.

    <h2>
      CONVERSATIONS WITH MRS. THRALE AND DR. JOHNSON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Streatham, Sunday, Aug. 23&mdash;I know not how to express the fullness of
      my contentment at this sweet place. All my best expectations are exceeded,
      and you know they were not very moderate. If, when my dear father comes,
      Susan and Mr. Crisp were to come too, I believe it would require at least
      a day's pondering to enable me to form another wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our journey was charming. The kind Mrs. Thrale would give courage to the
      most timid. She did not ask me questions, or catechise me upon what I
      knew, or use any means to draw me out, but made it her business to draw
      herself out, that is, to start subjects, to support them herself, and to
      take all the weight of the conversation, as if it behoved her to find me
      entertainment. But I am so much in love with her, that I shall be obliged
      to run away from the subject, or shall write of nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arrived here, Mrs. Thrale showed me my room, which is an
      exceedingly pleasant one, and then conducted me to the library, there to
      divert myself while she dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Thrale soon joined me: and I begin to like her. Mr. Thrale was
      neither well nor in spirits all day. Indeed, he seems not to be a happy
      man, though he has every means of happiness in his power. But I think I
      have rarely seen a very rich man with a light heart and light spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson was in the utmost good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no other company at the house all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, I had a delightful stroll with Mrs. Thrale, and she gave me
      a list of all her &ldquo;good neighbours&rdquo; in the town of Streatham, and said she
      was determined to take me to see Mr. T&mdash;, the clergyman, who was a
      character I could not but be diverted with, for he had so furious and so
      absurd a rage for building, that in his garden he had as many temples, and
      summer-houses, and statues as in the gardens of Stow, though he had so
      little room for them that they all seemed tumbling one upon another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, she was all unaffected drollery and sweet good humour. At tea we
      all met again, and Dr. Johnson was gaily sociable. He gave a very droll
      account of the children of Mr. Langton.<a href="#linknote-46"
       name="linknoteref-46" id="linknoteref-46">[46]</a> &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might
      be very good children if they were let alone; but the father is never easy
      when he is not making them do something which they cannot do; they must
      repeat a fable, or a speech, or the Hebrew alphabet; and they might as
      well count twenty, for what they know of the matter: however, the father
      says half, for he prompts every other word. But he could not have chosen a
      man who would have been less entertained by such means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale: &ldquo;nothing is more ridiculous than
      parents cramming their children's nonsense down other people's throats. I
      keep mine as much out of the way as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, madam,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;are in nobody's way&mdash;no children can be
      better managed or less troublesome; but your fault is, a too great
      perverseness in not allowing anybody to give them anything. Why should
      they not have a cherry, or a gooseberry, as well as bigger children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they are sure to return such gifts by wiping their hands upon the
      giver's gown or coat, and nothing makes children more offensive. People
      only make the offer to please the parents, and they wish the poor children
      at Jericho when they accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madam, it is a great deal more offensive to refuse them. Let those
      who make the offer look to their own gowns and coats, for when you
      interfere, they only wish you at Jericho.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;to please everybody.&rdquo; She then asked
      whether&mdash;Mr. Langton took any better care of his affairs than
      formerly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; cried the doctor, &ldquo;and never will; he complains of the ill
      effects of habit, and rests contentedly upon a confessed indolence. He
      told his father himself that he had 'no turn to economy;' but a thief
      might as well plead that he had 'no turn to honesty.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was not that excellent? At night, Mrs. Thrale asked if I would have
      anything? I answered, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but Dr. Johnson said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: she is used, madam, to suppers; she would like an egg or two, and a
      few slices of ham, or a rasher&mdash;a rasher, I believe, would please her
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How ridiculous! However, nothing could persuade Mrs. Thrale not to have
      the cloth laid: and Dr. Johnson was so facetious, that he challenged Mr.
      Thrale to get drunk!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my master<a href="#linknote-47" name="linknoteref-47"
       id="linknoteref-47">[47]</a> would say to me, Johnson, if you will oblige
      me, you will call for a bottle of Toulon, and then we will set to it,
      glass for glass, till it is done; and after that, I will say, Thrale, if
      you will oblige me, you will call for another bottle of Toulon, and then
      we will set to it, glass for glass, till that is done: and by the time we
      should have drunk the two bottles, we should be so happy, and such good
      friends, that we should fly into each other's arms, and both together call
      for the third!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now for this morning's breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson, as usual, came last into the library; he was in high spirits,
      and full of mirth and sport. I had the honour of sitting next to him: and
      now, all at once, he flung aside his reserve, thinking, perhaps, that it
      was time I should fling aside mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale told him that she intended taking me to Mr. T&mdash;'s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you ought, madam,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;'tis your business to be Cicerone to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly he snatched my hand, and kissing it, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;they
      will little think what a tartar you carry to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that they won't!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale; &ldquo;Miss Burney looks so meek and
      so quiet, nobody would suspect what a comical girl she is&mdash;-but I
      believe she has a great deal of malice at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's a toad!&rdquo; cried the doctor, laughing&mdash;&ldquo;a sly young rogue!
      with her Smiths and her Branghtons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;I hope you are well this morning!
      if one may judge by your spirits and good humour, the fever you threatened
      us with is gone off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had complained that he was going to be ill last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, madam, no,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I am not yet well. I could not sleep at
      all; there I lay, restless and uneasy, and thinking all the time of Miss
      Burney. Perhaps I have offended her, thought I; perhaps she is angry&mdash;I
      have seen her but once and I talked to her of a rasher!&mdash;Were you
      angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think I need not tell you my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been endeavouring to find some excuse,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and, as I
      could not sleep, I got up, and looked for some authority for the word; and
      I find, madam, it is used by Dryden: in one of his prologues, he says&mdash;'And
      snatch a homely rasher from the coals.' So you must not mind me, madam; I
      say strange things, but I mean no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was almost afraid he thought I was really idiot enough to have taken him
      seriously; but, a few minutes after, he put his hand on my arm, and
      shaking his head, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, you are a sly little rogue!&mdash;what a
      Holborn beau have you drawn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;the Holborn beau is Dr Johnson's
      favourite; and we have all your characters by heart, from Mr. Smith up to
      Lady Louisa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith is the man!&rdquo; cried he, laughing violently.
      &ldquo;Harry Fielding never drew so good a character!&mdash;such a fine varnish
      of low politeness!&mdash;such a struggle to appear a gentleman! Madam,
      there is no character better drawn anywhere&mdash;in any book or by any
      author.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I almost poked myself under the table. Never did I feel so delicious a
      confusion since I was born! But he added a great deal more, only I cannot
      recollect his exact words, and I do not choose to give him mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon when I went into the library, book hunting, Mrs. Thrale came to
      me. We had a very nice confab about various books, and exchanged opinions
      and imitations of Baretti; she told me many excellent tales of him, and I,
      in return, related my stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a long and very entertaining account of Dr. Goldsmith, who was
      intimately known here; but in speaking of &ldquo;The Good-natured Man,&rdquo; when I
      extolled my favourite Croaker, I found that admirable character was a
      downright theft from Dr. Johnson. Look at &ldquo;The Rambler,&rdquo; and you will find
      Suspirius is the man, and that not merely the idea, but the particulars of
      the character, are all stolen thence!<a href="#linknote-48"
       name="linknoteref-48" id="linknoteref-48">[48]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were yet reading this &ldquo;Rambler,&rdquo; Dr. Johnson came in: we told him
      what we were about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madam,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;Goldsmith was not scrupulous but he would have
      been a great man had he known the real value of his own internal
      resources.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;is fond of his 'Vicar of Wakefield.' and
      so am I;&mdash;don't you like it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, it is very faulty; there is nothing of real life in it, and
      very little of nature. It is a mere fanciful performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then seated himself upon a sofa, and calling to me, said &ldquo;Come,&mdash;Evelina,&mdash;come
      and sit by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed; and he took me almost in his arms,&mdash;that is, one of his
      arms, for one would go three times, at least, round me,&mdash;and, half
      laughing, half serious, he charged me to &ldquo;be a good girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; continued he with a very droll look, &ldquo;what makes you so
      fond of the Scotch? I don't like you for that;&mdash;I hate these Scotch,
      and so must you. I wish Branghton had sent the dog to jail! That Scotch
      dog Macartney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;don't you remember he says he would, but
      that he should get nothing by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ay, true,&rdquo; cried the doctor, see-sawing very solemnly, &ldquo;that,
      indeed, is some palliation for his forbearance. But I must not have you so
      fond of the Scotch, my little Burney; make your hero what you will but a
      Scotchman. Besides, you write Scotch&mdash;you say 'the one'&mdash;my
      dear, that's not English, never use that phrase again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;it may be used in Macartney's letter, and
      then it will be a propriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, no!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;you can't make a beauty of it&mdash;it is in
      the third volume; put it in Macartney's letter, and welcome&mdash;that, or
      any thing that is nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, surely,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;the poor man is used ill enough by the
      Branghtons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Branghton,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;only hates him because of his wretchedness&mdash;poor
      fellow!&mdash;But, my dear love, how should he ever have eaten a good
      dinner before he came to England? And then he laughed violently at young
      Branghton's idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;I always liked Macartney; he is a very pretty
      character, and I took to him, as the folks say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I like Macartney myself. Yes, poor fellow, I
      liked the man, but I love not the nation.&rdquo; And then he proceeded, in a dry
      manner, to make at once sarcastic reflections on the Scotch, and
      flattering speeches to me.<a href="#linknote-49" name="linknoteref-49"

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON ON SOME &ldquo;LADIES&rdquo; OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Dr. Johnson was again all himself; and so civil to
      me!&mdash;even admiring how I dressed myself! Indeed, it is well I have so
      much of his favour&mdash;for it seems he always speaks his mind concerning
      the dress of ladies, and all ladies who are here obey his injunctions
      implicitly, and alter whatever he disapproves. This is a part of his
      character that much surprises me: but notwithstanding he is sometimes so
      absent, and always so near sighted, he scrutinizes into every part of
      almost everybody's appearance. They tell me of a Miss Brown, who often
      visits here, and who has a slovenly way of dressing. &ldquo;And when she comes
      down in a morning,&rdquo; says Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;her hair will be all loose, and her
      cap half off; and then Dr. Johnson, who sees something is wrong, and does
      not know where the fault is, concludes it is in the cap, and says, &ldquo;My
      dear, what do you wear such a vile cap for?&rdquo; &ldquo;I'll change it, Sir!&rdquo; cries
      the poor girl, &ldquo;if you don't like it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, do,&rdquo; he says; and away runs
      poor Miss Brown; but when she gets on another, it's the same thing, for
      the cap has nothing to do with the fault. And then she wonders Dr. Johnson
      should not like the cap, for she thinks it very pretty. And so on with her
      gown, which he also makes her change; but if the poor girl were to change
      through all her wardrobe, unless she could put her things on better, he
      would still find fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Johnson was gone, she told me of my mother's<a href="#linknote-50"
       name="linknoteref-50" id="linknoteref-50">[50]</a> being obliged to change
      her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she &ldquo;Mrs. Burney had on a very pretty linen jacket and coat,
      and was going to church; but Dr. Johnson, who, I suppose, did not like her
      in a jacket, saw something was the matter, and so found fault with the
      linen: and he looked and peered, and then said, 'Why, madam, this won't
      do! you must not go to church so!' So away went poor Mrs. Burney, and
      changed her gown! And when she had done so, he did not like it, but he did
      not know why, so he told her she should not wear a black hat and cloak in
      summer! How he did bother poor Mrs. Burney! and himself too, for if the
      things had been put on to his mind, he would have taken no notice of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mr. Thrale, very drily, &ldquo;I don't think Mrs. Burney a very good
      dresser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last time she came,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;she was in a white cloak, and she
      told Dr. Johnson she had got her old white cloak scoured on purpose to
      oblige him! 'Scoured!' says he; 'ay, have you, madam?'&mdash;so he
      see-sawed, for he could not for shame find fault, but he did not seem to
      like the scouring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now let me try to recollect an account he gave of certain celebrated
      ladies of his acquaintance: an account in which, had you heard it from
      himself, would have made you die with laughing, his manner is so peculiar,
      and enforces his humour so originally. It was begun by Mrs. Thrale's
      apologising to him for troubling him with some question she thought
      trifling&mdash;O, I remember! We had been talking of colours, and of the
      fantastic names given to them, and why the palest lilac should b called a
      soupir etouffe; and when Dr. Johnson came in, she applied to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; said he, with wonderful readiness, &ldquo;it is called a stifled
      sigh because it is checked in its progress, and only half a colour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help expressing my amazement at his universal readiness upon
      all subjects, and Mrs. Thrale said to him, &ldquo;Sir, Miss Burney wonders at
      your patience with such stuff, but I tell her you are used to me, for I
      believe I torment you with more foolish questions than anybody else dares
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you don't torment me;&mdash;you teaze me, indeed,
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, so I do, Dr. Johnson, and I wonder you bear with my nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, you never talk nonsense; you have as much sense and more wit,
      than any woman I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, blushing, &ldquo;it is my turn to go under the table
      this morning, Miss Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; continued the doctor, with the most comical look, &ldquo;I have known
      all the wits, from Mrs. Montagu down to Bet Flint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet Flint cried Mrs. Thrale&mdash;pray, who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a fine character, madam! She was habitually a slut and a drunkard,
      and occasionally a thief and a harlot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, for heaven's sake, how came you to know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madam, she figured in the literary world, too! Bet Flint wrote her
      own life, and called herself Cassandra, and it was in verse;&mdash;it
      began:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'When Nature first ordained my birth,
    A diminutive I was born on earth:
    And then I came from a dark abode,
    Into a gay and gaudy world.'<a href="#linknote-51" name="linknoteref-51"
       id="linknoteref-51">[51]</a>
</pre>
    <p>
      So Bet brought me her verses to correct; but I gave her half-a-crown, and
      she liked it as well. Bet had a fine spirit;&mdash;she advertised for a
      husband, but she had no success, for she told me no man aspired to her!
      Then she hired very handsome lodgings and a footboy; and she got a
      harpsichord, but Bet could not play; however, she put herself in fine
      attitudes, and drummed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave an account of another of these geniuses, who called herself
      by some fine name, I have forgotten what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had not quite the same stock of virtue,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;nor the same
      stock of honesty as Bet Flint; but I suppose she envied her
      accomplishments, for she was so little moved by the power of harmony, that
      while Bet Flint thought she was drumming very divinely, the other jade had
      her indicted for a nuisance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what became of her, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madam, she stole a quilt from the man of the house, and he had her
      taken up: but Bet Flint had a spirit not to be subdued; so when she found
      herself obliged to go to jail, she ordered a sedan chair, and bid her
      footboy walk before her. However, the boy proved refractory, for he was
      ashamed, though his mistress was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did she ever get out of jail again, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam; when she came to her trial the judge acquitted her. 'So now,'
      she said to me, 'the quilt is MY own, and now I'll make a petticoat of
      it.' Oh, I loved Bet Flint!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-52" name="linknoteref-52"
       id="linknoteref-52">[52]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how we all laughed! Then he gave an account of another lady, who
      called herself Laurinda, and who also wrote verses and stole furniture;
      but he had not the same affection for her, he said, though she too &ldquo;was a
      lady who had high notions of honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the history of another, who called herself Hortensia, and
      who walked up and down the park repeating a book of Virgil. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;though I know her story, I never had the good fortune to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this he gave us an account of the famous Mrs. Pinkethman: &ldquo;And she,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;told me she owed all her misfortunes to her wit; for she was so
      unhappy as to marry a man who thought himself also a wit, though I believe
      she gave him not implicit credit for it, but it occasioned much
      contradiction and ill-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, sir,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;how can all these vagabonds contrive
      to get at you, of all people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O the dear creatures!&rdquo; cried he, laughing heartily, &ldquo;I can't but be glad
      to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I wonder, sir, you never went to see Mrs. Rudd,<a href="#linknote-53"
       name="linknoteref-53" id="linknoteref-53">[53]</a> among the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madam, I believe I should,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if it was not for the
      newspapers; but I am prevented many frolics that I should like very well,
      since I am become such a theme for the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, would you ever have imagined this? Bet Flint, it seems, took Kitty
      Fisher<a href="#linknote-54" name="linknoteref-54" id="linknoteref-54">[54]</a>
      to see him, but to his no little regret he was not at home. &ldquo;And Mrs.
      Williams,"<a href="#linknote-55" name="linknoteref-55" id="linknoteref-55">[55]</a>
      he added, &ldquo;did not love Bet Flint, but Bet Flint made herself very easy
      about that.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A LEARNED MAN ON &ldquo;EVELINA.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      When we were dressed for dinner, and went into the parlour, we had the
      agreeable surprise of seeing Mr. Seward. There was also Mr. Lort,<a
      href="#linknote-56" name="linknoteref-56" id="linknoteref-56">[56]</a> who
      is reckoned one of the most learned men alive, and is also a collector of
      curiosities, alike in literature and natural history. His manners are
      somewhat blunt and odd, and he is altogether out of the common road,
      without having chosen a better path.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was passed most agreeably. In the evening we had, as usual, a
      literary conversation. Mr. Lort produced several curious MSS. of the
      famous Bristol Chatterton; among others, his will, and divers verses
      written against Dr. Johnson, as a placeman and pensioner; all of which he
      read aloud, with a steady voice and unmoved countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished at him; Mrs. Thrale not much pleased; Mr. Thrale silent
      and attentive; and Mr. Seward was slily laughing. Dr. Johnson himself
      listened profoundly and laughed openly. Indeed, I believe he wishes his
      abusers no other thing than a good dinner, like Pope.<a href="#linknote-57"
       name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57">[57]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as we had got our biscuits and toast-and-water, which make the
      Streatham supper, and which, indeed, is all there is any chance of eating
      after our late and great dinners, Mr. Lort suddenly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, ma'am, have you heard anything of a novel that runs about a good
      deal, called 'Evelina'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a ferment did this question, before such a set, put me in! I did not
      know whether he spoke to me, or Mrs. Thrale, and Mrs. Thrale was in the
      same doubt, and as she owned, felt herself in a little palpitation for me,
      not knowing what might come next, Between us both, therefore, he had no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been recommended to me,&rdquo; continued he; &ldquo;but I have no great desire
      to see it, because it has such a foolish name. Yet I have heard a great
      deal of it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then repeated &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo;&mdash;in a very languishing and ridiculous
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart beat so quick against my stays that I almost panted with extreme
      agitation, from the dread either of hearing some horrible criticism, or of
      being betrayed: and I munched my biscuit as if I had not eaten for a
      fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe the whole party were in some little consternation Dr. Johnson
      began see-sawing; Mr. Thrale awoke; Mr. E&mdash;&mdash; who I fear has
      picked up some notion of the affair from being so much in the house,
      grinned amazingly; and Mr. Seward, biting his nails and flinging himself
      back in his chair, I am sure had wickedness enough to enjoy the whole
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale was really a little fluttered, but without looking at me,
      said, &ldquo;And pray what, Mr. Lort, what have you heard of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why they say,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;that it's an account of a young lady's first
      entrance into company, and of the scrapes she gets into; and they say
      there's a great deal of character in it, but I have not cared to look in
      it, because the name is so foolish&mdash;'Evelina'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why foolish, sir?&rdquo; cried Dr. Johnson. &ldquo;Where's the folly of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I won't say much for the name myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;to those
      who don't know the reason of it, which I found out, but which nobody else
      seems to know.&rdquo; She then explained the name from Evelyn, according to my
      own meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;if that was the reason, it is a very good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, have you had the book here?&rdquo; cried Mr. Lort, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, indeed, have we,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale; &ldquo;I read it when I was last
      confined, and I laughed over it, and I cried over it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ho!&rdquo; said Mr. Lort, &ldquo;this is another thing! If you have had it here, I
      will certainly read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had it? ay,&rdquo; returned she; &ldquo;and Dr. Johnson, who would not look at it at
      first, was so caught by it when I put it in the coach with him, that he
      has sung its praises ever since,&mdash;and he says Richardson would have
      been proud to have written it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ho! this is a good hearing,&rdquo; cried Mr. Lort; &ldquo;if Dr. Johnson can read
      it, I shall get it with all speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not go far for it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;for it's now upon yonder
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could sit still no longer; there was something so awkward, so uncommon,
      so strange in my then situation, that I wished myself a hundred miles off,
      and indeed, I had almost choked myself with the biscuit, for I could not
      for my life swallow it: and so I got up, and, as Mr. Lort went to the
      table to look for &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; I left the room, and was forced to call for
      water to wash down the biscuit, which literally stuck in my throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heartily wished Mr. Lort at Jerusalem. I did not much like going back,
      but the moment I recovered breath, I resolved not to make bad worse by
      staying longer away: but at the door of the room, I met Mrs. Thrale, who,
      asking me if I would have some water, took me into a back room, and burst
      into a hearty fit of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very good sport,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;the man is as innocent about the
      matter as a child, and we shall hear what he says about it to-morrow
      morning at breakfast. I made a sign to Dr. Johnson and Seward not to tell
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She found I was not in a humour to think it such good sport as she did,
      she grew more serious, and taking my hand kindly said, &ldquo;May you never,
      Miss Burney, know any other pain than that of hearing yourself praised!
      and I am sure that you must often feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I told her how much I dreaded being discovered, and begged her not to
      betray me any further, she again began laughing, and openly declared she
      should not consult me about the matter. But she told me that, as soon as I
      had left the room, when Mr. Lort took up &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; he exclaimed
      contemptuously &ldquo;Why, it's printed for Lowndes!&rdquo; and that Dr. Johnson then
      told him there were things and characters in it more than worthy of
      Fielding. &ldquo;Oh ho!&rdquo; cried Mr. Lort; &ldquo;what, is it better than Fielding?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Harry Fielding,&rdquo; answered Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;knew nothing but the shell of
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you, ma'am,&rdquo; added the flattering Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;have found the
      kernel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Are they all mad? or do they only want to make me so

    <h2>
      CURIOSITY REGARDING THE AUTHOR OF &ldquo;EVELINA.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Streatham, Sept.</i>&mdash;Our Monday's intended great party was very
      small, for people are so dispersed at present in various quarters: we had,
      therefore, only Sir Joshua Reynolds, two Miss Palmers, Dr. Calvert, Mr.
      Rose Fuller, and Lady Ladd.<a href="#linknote-58" name="linknoteref-58"
       id="linknoteref-58">[58]</a> Dr. Johnson did not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua I am much pleased with: I like his countenance, and I like his
      manners; the former I think expressive, and sensible; the latter gentle,
      unassuming, and engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner, in quantity as well as quality, would have sufficed for forty
      people. Sir Joshua said, when the dessert appeared, &ldquo;Now if all the
      company should take a fancy to the same dish, there would be sufficient
      for all the company from any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, as usual, we strolled out: I ran first into the hall for my
      cloak, and Mrs. Thrale, running after me, said in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are taxed with 'Evelina,' don't own it; I intend to say it is
      mine, for sport's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may think how much I was surprised, and how readily I agreed not to
      own it; but I could ask no questions, for the two Miss Palmers followed
      close, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now pray, ma'am, tell us who it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;who it is, you must find out. I have told
      you that you dined with the author; but the rest you must make out as you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Thrale began tittering violently, but I entreated her not to betray
      me; and, as soon as I could, I got Mrs. Thrale to tell me what all this
      meant. She then acquainted me, that, when she first came into the parlour,
      she found them all busy in talking of &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; and heard that Sir Joshua
      had declared he would give fifty pounds to know the author!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;thus much, then, I will tell you; the author
      will dine with you to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were then all distracted to know the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we shall have Dr. Calvert, Lady Ladd, Rose Fuller, and
      Miss Burney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney?&rdquo; quoth they, &ldquo;which Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the eldest, Miss Fanny Burney; and so out of this list you must make
      out the author.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head at her, but begged her, at least, to go no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried she, laughing, &ldquo;leave me alone; the fun will be to make
      them think it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, as I learnt at night, when they were gone, Sir Joshua was so very
      importunate with Mr. Thrale, and attacked him with such eagerness, that he
      made him confess who it was, as soon as the ladies retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, to return to our walk. The Miss Palmers grew more and more urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we indeed,&rdquo; said the eldest, &ldquo;dine with the author of 'Evelina?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in good truth did you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, ma'am, it was yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't tell you whether it was or not; but were there not other people
      at dinner besides me? What think you of Dr. Calvert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Calvert? no! no; I am sure it was not he: besides, they say it was
      certainly written by a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a woman? nay, then, is not here Lady Ladd, and Miss Burney, and
      Hester?"<a href="#linknote-59" name="linknoteref-59" id="linknoteref-59">[59]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Ladd I am sure it was not, nor could it be Miss Thrale's. O maam! I
      begin to think it was really yours! Now, was it not, Mrs. Thrale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady of our acquaintance,&rdquo; said Miss Palmer, &ldquo;Mrs. Cholmondeley, went
      herself to the printer, but he would not tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he not?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;why, then, he's an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is he so?&mdash;nay, then, it is certainly Mrs. Thrale's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I told you before I should not deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;pray do you deny it?&rdquo; in a voice that seemed to
      say,&mdash;I must ask round, though rather from civility than suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;well no: if nobody else will deny it, why should I? It
      does not seem the fashion to deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, in truth,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;I believe nobody would think of denying it
      that could claim it, for it is the sweetest book in the world. My uncle
      could not go to bed till he had finished it, and he says he is sure he
      shall make love to the author, if ever he meets with her, and it should
      really be a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam,&rdquo; cried Miss Offy, &ldquo;I am sure it was you but why will you not
      own it at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall neither own nor deny anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman whom we know very well,&rdquo; said Miss Palmer, &ldquo;when he could
      learn nothing at the printer's, took the trouble to go all about Snow
      Hill, to see if he could find any silversmith's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he was a cunning creature!&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale; &ldquo;but Dr. Johnson's
      favourite is Mr. Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is of everybody,&rdquo; answered she: &ldquo;he and all that family; everybody
      says such a family never was drawn before. But Mrs. Cholmondeley's
      favourite is Madame Duval; she acts her from morning to night, and
      ma-foi's everybody she sees. But though we all want so much to know the
      author, both Mrs. Cholmondeley and my uncle himself say they should be
      frightened to death to be in her company, because she must be such a very
      nice observer, that there would be no escaping her with safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What strange ideas are taken from mere book-reading! But what follows gave
      me the highest delight I can feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burke,"<a href="#linknote-60" name="linknoteref-60"
       id="linknoteref-60">[60]</a> she continued, &ldquo;doats on it: he began it one
      morning at seven o'clock, and could not leave it a moment; he sat up all
      night reading it. He says he has not seen such a book he can't tell when.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale gave me involuntarily a look of congratulation, and could not
      forbear exclaiming, &ldquo;How glad she was Mr. Burke approved it!&rdquo; This served
      to confirm the Palmers in their mistake, and they now, without further
      questioning, quietly and unaffectedly concluded the book to be really Mrs.
      Thrale's and Miss Palmer said,&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed, ma'am, you ought to write a
      novel every year: nobody can write like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was both delighted and diverted at this mistake, and they grew so easy
      and so satisfied under it, that the conversation dropped, and off we went
      to the harpsichord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, the party broke up, and they took leave. I had no
      conversation with Sir Joshua all day; but I found myself more an object of
      attention to him than I wished; and he several times spoke to me, though
      he did not make love!
    </p>
    <p>
      When they rose to take leave, Miss Palmer, with the air of asking the
      greatest of favours, hoped to see me when I returned to town; and Sir
      Joshua, approaching me with the most profound respect, inquired how long I
      should remain at Streatham? A week, I believed: and then he hoped, when I
      left it, they should have the honour of seeing me in Leicester Square.<a
      href="#linknote-61" name="linknoteref-61" id="linknoteref-61">[61]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the joke is, the people speak as if they were afraid of me,
      instead of my being afraid of them. It seems, when they got to the door,
      Miss Palmer said to Mrs. Thrale,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am, so it's Miss Burney after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sure,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;who should it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! why did not you tell us sooner?&rdquo; said Offy, &ldquo;that we might have had a
      little talk about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, therefore, end all my hopes of secrecy!

    <h2>
      THE MEMBERS OF DR. JOHNSON'S HOUSEHOLD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At tea-time the subject turned upon the domestic economy of Dr. Johnson's
      household. Mrs. Thrale has often acquainted me that his house is quite
      filled and overrun with all sorts of strange creatures, whom he admits for
      mere charity, and because nobody else will admit them,&mdash;for his
      charity is unbounded; or, rather, bounded only by his circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account he gave of the adventures and absurdities of the set, was
      highly diverting, but too diffused for writing&mdash;though one or two
      speeches I must give. I think I shall occasionally theatricalise my
      dialogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale&mdash;Pray, Sir, how does Mrs. Williams like all this tribe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson&mdash;Madam, she does not like them at all: but their fondness for
      her is not greater. She and De Mullin<a href="#linknote-62"
       name="linknoteref-62" id="linknoteref-62">[62]</a> quarrel incessantly;
      but as they can both be occasionally of service to each other, and as
      neither of them have a place to go to, their animosity does not force them
      to separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.&mdash;And pray, sir, what is Mr. Macbean?<a href="#linknote-63"
       name="linknoteref-63" id="linknoteref-63">[63]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;Madam, he is a Scotchman: he is a man of great learning, and
      for his learning I respect him, and I wish to serve him. He knows many
      languages, and knows them well; but he knows nothing of life. I advised
      him to write a geographical dictionary; but I have lost all hopes of his
      doing anything properly, since I found he gave as much labour to Capua as
      to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. T.&mdash;And pray who is clerk of your kitchen, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;Why, sir, I am afraid there is none; a general anarchy
      prevails in my kitchen, as I am told by Mr. Levat,<a href="#linknote-64"
       name="linknoteref-64" id="linknoteref-64">[64]</a> who says it is not now
      what it used to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.&mdash;Mr. Levat, I suppose, sir, has the office of keeping the
      hospital in health? for he is an apothecary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;Levat, madam, is a brutal fellow, but I have a good regard
      for him; for his brutality is in his manners, not his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. T.&mdash;But how do you get your dinners drest?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;Why De Mullin has the chief management of the kitchen; but
      our roasting is not magnificent, for we have no jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. T.&mdash;No jack? Why, how do they manage without?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;Small joints, I believe, they manage with a string, larger
      are done at the tavern. I have some thoughts (with profound gravity) of
      buying a jack, because I think a jack is some credit to a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. T.&mdash;Well, but you'll have a spit, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;No, sir, no; that would be superfluous; for we shall never
      use it; and if a jack is seen, a spit will be presumed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.&mdash;But pray, sir, who is the Poll you talk of? She that you
      used to abet in her quarrels with Mrs. Williams, and call out, &ldquo;At her
      again, Poll! Never flinch, Poll."<a href="#linknote-65"
       name="linknoteref-65" id="linknoteref-65">[65]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;Why, I took to Poll very well at first, but she won't do upon
      a nearer examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.&mdash;How came she among you, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.&mdash;Why I don't rightly remember, but we could spare her very
      well from us. Poll is a stupid slut; I had some hopes of her at first; but
      when I talked to her tightly and closely, I could make nothing of her; she
      was wiggle waggle, and I could never persuade her to be categorical, I
      wish Miss Burney would come among us; if she would only give <i>us</i> a
      week, we should furnish her with ample materials for a new scene in her
      next work.

    <h2>
      ANTICIPATED VISIT FROM MRS. MONTAGU.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [&ldquo;The great Mrs. Montagu&rdquo; deserves a somewhat longer notice
     than can be conveniently compressed within the limits of a
     footnote. She was as indisputably, in public estimation, the
     leading literary lady of the time, as Johnson was the
     leading man of letters.  Her maiden name was Elizabeth
     Robinson.  She was born at York in the year 1720, and
     married, in 1742, Edward Montagu, grandson of the first Earl
     of Sandwich.  Her husband's death, in 1775, left her in the
     possession of a handsome fortune.  Mrs. Montagu's literary
     celebrity was by no means dearly bought, for it rested,
     almost exclusively, on her &ldquo;Essay on the Writings and Genius
     of Shakespear,&rdquo; published by Dodsley in 1769.  Indeed, the
     only other writings which she committed to the press were
     three &ldquo;Dialogues of the Dead,&rdquo; appended to the Well-known
     &ldquo;Dialogues&rdquo; of her friend, Lord Lyttelton.  The &ldquo;Essay&rdquo; is
     an elegantly written little work, superficial when regarded
     in the light of modern criticism, but marked by good sense
     and discrimination. One of the chief objects of the
     authoress was to defend Shakespeare against the strictures
     of Voltaire, and in this not very difficult task she has
     undoubtedly succeeded.  Johnson's opinion of the &ldquo;Essay&rdquo; was
     unfavourable.  To Sir Joshua Reynolds's remark, that it did
     honour to its authoress, he replied: &ldquo;Yes Sir: it does her
     honour, but it would do nobody else honour;&rdquo; and he goes on
     to observe that &ldquo;there is not one sentence of true criticism
     in the book.&rdquo;  But if the general applause which the book
     had excited was out of all proportion to its merits,
     Johnson's unqualified condemnation was more than equally
     disproportionate to its defects.

     Of Mrs. Montagu's conversational abilities Johnson
     entertained a higher opinion. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;that
     lady exerts more mind in conversation than any person I ever
     met with&rdquo; (Miss Reynolds's Recollections).  It was probably,
     indeed, to the fame of her conversation, and of the has been
     parties which assembled at her house, that she owed the
     greater part of her reputation. She was the acknowledged
     &ldquo;Queen of the Blue Stockings&rdquo; although the epithet
     originated with a rival giver of literary parties, Mrs.
     Vesey, who, replying to the apology of a gentleman who
     declined an invitation to one of her meetings on the plea of
     want of dress, exclaimed, &ldquo;Pho, pho! don't mind dress! Come
     in your blue stockings!&rdquo;  The term &ldquo;Blue Stocking&rdquo; (bas
     bleu) was thenceforward applied to the set which met at Mrs.
     Vesey's, and was gradually extended to other coteries of
     similar character.

     The charitable and beneficient disposition of Mrs. Montagu
     was as notorious as her intellectual superiority.  It may be
     interesting here to observe that after her husband's death,
     in 1775, she doubled the income of poor Anna Williams, the
     blind poetess who resided with Dr. Johnson, by settling upon
     her an annuity of ten pounds.  The publication of Johnson's
     &ldquo;Lives of the Poets,&rdquo; in 1781, occasioned a coolness between
     the doctor and Mrs. Montagu, on account of the severity with
     which, in that work, he had handled the character of Lord
     Lyttelton.  In September, 1783, however, Dr. Johnson wrote
     to the lady to announce the death of her pensioner, Miss
     Williams; and shortly afterwards he informs Mrs. Thrale that
     he has received a reply &ldquo;not only civil but tender; so I
     hope peace is proclaimed.&rdquo;  Mrs. Montagu died at her house
     in Portman Square, in the year 1800.&mdash;ED.]
</pre>
    <p>
      I was looking over the &ldquo;Life of Cowley,&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-66"
       name="linknoteref-66" id="linknoteref-66">[66]</a>which Dr. Johnson had
      himself given me to read, at the same time that he gave to Mrs. Thrale
      that of Waller. But he bade me put it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;put away that now, and prattle with us; I can't make this
      little Burney prattle, and I am sure she prattles well; but I shall teach
      her another lesson than to sit thus silent before I have done with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;is the only lesson I shall be backward to learn from
      you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall give me,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;a discourse upon the passions: come,
      begin! Tell us the necessity of regulating them Watching over and curbing
      them! Did you ever read Norris's &ldquo;Theory of Love?"<a href="#linknote-67"
       name="linknoteref-67" id="linknoteref-67">[67]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said I, laughing, yet staring a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-It is well worth your reading. He will make you see that inordinate
      love is the root of all evil, inordinate love of wealth brings on avarice;
      of wine, brings on intemperance; of power, brings on cruelty; and so on.
      He deduces from inordinate love all human frailty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-To-morrow, sir, Mrs. Montagu dines here, and then you will have
      talk enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson began to see-saw, with a countenance strongly expressive of
      inward fun, and after enjoying it some time in silence, he suddenly, and
      with great animation, turned to me and cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with her, Burney!&mdash;down with her!&mdash;spare her not!&mdash;attack
      her, fight her, and down with her at once! You are a rising wit, and she
      is at the top; and when I was beginning the world, and was nothing and
      nobody, the joy of my life was to fire at all the established wits! and
      then everybody loved to halloo me on. But there is no game now; every body
      would be glad to see me conquered: but then, when I was new, to vanquish
      the great ones was all the delight of my poor little dear soul! So at her,
      Burney&mdash;at her, and down with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how we were all amused! By the way I must tell you that Mrs. Montagu
      is in very great estimation here, even with Dr. Johnson himself, when
      others do not praise her improperly. Mrs. Thrale ranks her as the first of
      women in the literary way. I should have told you that Miss Gregory,
      daughter of the Gregory who wrote the &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Legacy of Advice,&rdquo;
       lives with Mrs. Montagu, and was invited to accompany her.<a
      href="#linknote-68" name="linknoteref-68" id="linknoteref-68">[68]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark now,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;if I contradict her tomorrow. I am
      determined, let her say what she will, that I will not contradict her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Why, to be sure, sir, you did put her a little out Of countenance
      the last time she came. Yet you were neither rough, nor cruel, nor
      ill-natured, but still, when a lady changes colour, we imagine her
      feelings are not quite composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Why, madam, I won't answer that I shan't contradict her again, if
      she provokes me as she did then; but a less provocation I will withstand.
      I believe I am not high in her good graces already; and I begin, added he,
      laughing heartily, to tremble for my admission into her new house. I doubt
      I shall never see the inside of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Mrs. Montagu is building a most superb house.)<a href="#linknote-69"
       name="linknoteref-69" id="linknoteref-69">[69]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Oh, I warrant you, she fears you, indeed; but that, you know, is
      nothing uncommon: and dearly I love to hear your disquisitions; for
      certainly she is the first woman for literary knowledge in England, and if
      in England, I hope I may say in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-I believe you may, madam. She diffuses more knowledge in her
      conversation than any woman I know, or, indeed, almost any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-I declare I know no man equal to her, take away yourself and
      Burke, for that art. And you who love magnificence, won't quarrel with
      her, as everybody else does, for her love of finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-No, I shall not quarrel with her upon that topic.

    <h2>
      FANNY BURNEY'S INTRODUCTION TO A CELEBRATED &ldquo;BLUE-STOCKING.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;We could not prevail with Dr. Johnson to stay till
      Mrs. Montagu arrived, though, by appointment, she came very early. She and
      Miss Gregory came by one o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no party to meet her. She is middle-sized, very thin, and looks
      infirm; she has a sensible and penetrating countenance, and the air and
      manner of a woman accustomed to being distinguished, and of great parts.
      Dr. Johnson, who agrees in this, told us that a Mrs. Hervey, of his
      acquaintance, says she can remember Mrs. Montagu trying for this same air
      and manner. Mr. Crisp has said the same: however, nobody can now
      impartially see her, and not confess that she has extremely well
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectations, which were compounded of the praise of Mrs. Thrale, and
      the abuse of Mr. Crisp, were most exactly, answered, for I thought her in
      a medium way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gregory is a fine young woman, and seems gentle and well-bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bustle with the dog Presto&mdash;Mrs. Thrale's favourite&mdash;at the
      entrance of these ladies into the library, prevented any formal reception;
      but as soon as Mrs. Montagu heard my name, she inquired very civilly after
      my father, and made many speeches concerning a volume of &ldquo;Linguet,"<a
      href="#linknote-70" name="linknoteref-70" id="linknoteref-70">[70]</a>
      which she has lost; but she hopes soon to be able to replace it. I am sure
      he is very high in her favour, because she did me the honour of addressing
      herself to me three or four times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my ease and tranquillity were soon disturbed: for she had not been in
      the room more than ten minutes, ere, turning to Mrs. Thrale, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ma'am&mdash;but your 'Evelina'&mdash;I have not yet got it. I sent
      for it, but the bookseller had it not. However, I will certainly have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I hope so,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;and I hope you will like it too;
      for 'tis a book to be liked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began now a vehement nose-blowing, for the benefit of handkerchiefing my
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope though,&rdquo; said Mrs. Montagu, drily, &ldquo;it is not in verse? I can read
      anything in prose, but I have a great dread of a long story in verse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am, no; 'tis all in prose, I assure you. 'Tis a novel; and an
      exceeding&mdash;but it does nothing good to be praised too much, so I will
      say nothing more about it: only this, that Mr. Burke sat up all night to
      read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? Well, I propose myself great pleasure from it and I am gratified
      by hearing it is written by a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Sir Joshua Reynolds,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;has been offering fifty
      pounds to know the author.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will have it to read on my journey; I am going to Berkshire, and
      it shall be my travelling book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am if you please you shall have it now. Queeny, do look it for
      Mrs. Montagu, and let it be put in her carriage, and go to town with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Thrale rose to look for it, and involuntarily I rose too, intending
      to walk off, for my situation was inexpressibly awkward; but then I
      recollected that if I went away, it might seem like giving Mrs. Thrale
      leave and opportunity to tell my tale, and therefore I stopped at a
      distant window, where I busied myself in contemplating the poultry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dr. Johnson, ma'am,&rdquo; added my kind puffer, &ldquo;says Fielding never wrote
      so well&mdash;never wrote equal to this book; he says it is a better
      picture of life and manners than is to be found anywhere in Fielding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Montagu, surprised; &ldquo;that I did not expect, for I
      have been informed it is the work of a young lady and therefore, though I
      expected a very pretty book, I supposed it to be a work of mere
      imagination, and the name I thought attractive; but life and manners I
      never dreamt of finding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma'am, what I tell you is literally true; and for my part, I am
      never better pleased than when good girls write clever books&mdash;and
      that this is clever&mdash;But all this time we are killing Miss Burney,
      who wrote the book herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a clap of thunder was this!&mdash;the last thing in the world I
      should have expected before my face? I know not what bewitched Mrs.
      Thrale, but this was carrying the jest further than ever. All retenu being
      now at an end, I fairly and abruptly took to my heels, and ran out of the
      room with the utmost trepidation, amidst astonished exclamations from Mrs.
      Montagu and Miss Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was horribly disconcerted, but I am now so irrecoverably in for it, that
      I begin to leave off reproaches and expostulations; indeed, they have very
      little availed me while they might have been of service, but now they
      would pass for mere parade and affectation; and therefore since they can
      do no good, I gulp them down. I find them, indeed, somewhat hard of
      digestion, but they must make their own way as well as they can.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined not to make my appearance again till dinner was upon table;
      yet I could neither read nor write, nor indeed do any thing but consider
      the new situation in life into which I am thus hurried&mdash;I had almost
      said forced&mdash;and if I had, methinks it would be no untruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Thrale came laughing up after me, and tried to persuade me to return.
      She was mightily diverted all the morning, and came to me with repeated
      messages of summons to attend the company, but I could not brave it again
      into the roon, and therefore entreated her to say I was finishing a
      letter. Yet I was sorry to lose so much of Mrs. Montagu.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was upon table, I followed the procession, in a tragedy step,
      as Mr. Thrale will have it, into the dining parlour. Dr. Johnson was
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was not brilliant, nor do I remember much of it; but Mrs.
      Montagu behaved to me just as I could have wished, since she spoke to me
      very little, but spoke that little with the utmost politeness. But Miss
      Gregory, though herself a modest girl, quite stared me out of countenance,
      and never took her eyes off my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Montagu's new house was talked of, Dr. Johnson, in a jocose
      manner, desired to know if he should be invited to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sure,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Montagu, looking well pleased; &ldquo;or I shan't like
      it: but I invite you all to a house warming; I shall hope for the honour
      of seeing all this company at my new house next Easter day: I fix the day
      now that it may be remembered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody bowed and accepted the invite but me, and I thought fitting not
      to hear it; for I have no notion of snapping at invites from the eminent.
      But Dr. Johnson, who sat next to me, was determined I should be of the
      party, for he suddenly clapped his hand on my shoulder, and called out
      aloud,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Burney, you and I will go together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, surely,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Montagu, &ldquo;I shall hope for the pleasure of
      seeing 'Evelina.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Evelina'&rdquo; repeated he; &ldquo;has Mrs. Montagu then found out 'Evelina?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;and I am proud of it: I am proud that a work so
      commended should be a woman's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How my face burnt!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mrs. Montagu,&rdquo; asked Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;read 'Evelina?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not yet; but I shall immediately, for I feel the greatest
      eagerness to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, madam,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that you have not already, read it,
      because you cannot speak of it with a full conviction of its merit: which,
      I believe, when you have read it, you will have great pleasure in
      acknowledging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some other things were said, but I remember them not, for I could hardly
      keep my place: but my sweet, naughty Mrs. Thrale looked delighted for
      me....
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, how did Dr. Johnson astonish me by asking if I had
      observed what an ugly cap Miss Gregory had on? Then taking both my hands,
      and looking at me with an expression of much kindness, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Burney, Mrs. Montagu now will read 'Evelina'&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale then told me such civil things. Mrs. Montagu, it seems, during
      my retreat, inquired very particularly what kind of book it was?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I told her,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;that it was a picture of life,
      manners, and characters. 'But won't she go on,' says she; 'surely she
      won't stop here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why,' said I, 'I want her to go on in a new path&mdash;I want her to
      write a comedy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But,' said Mrs. Montagu, 'one thing must be considered; Fielding, who
      was so admirable in novel writing, never succeeded when he wrote for the
      stage.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well said,&rdquo; cried Dr. Johnson &ldquo;that was an answer which showed she
      considered her subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, but a propos,' said Mrs. Montagu, 'if Miss Burney does write a
      play, I beg I may know of it; or, if she thinks proper, see it; and all my
      influence is at her service. We shall all be glad to assist in spreading
      the fame of Miss Burney.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tremble for what all this will end in. I verily think I had best stop
      where I am, and never again attempt writing: for after so much honour, so
      much success&mdash;how shall I bear a downfall?

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON'S COMPLIMENTS AND GROSS SPEECHES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, Sept. 21</i>.&mdash;I have had a thousand delightful
      conversations with Dr. Johnson, who, whether he loves me or not, I am sure
      seems to have some opinion of my discretion, for he speaks of all this
      house to me with unbounded confidence, neither diminishing faults, nor
      exaggerating praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever he is below stairs he keeps me a prisoner, for he does not like I
      should quit the room a moment; if I rise he constantly calls out, &ldquo;Don't
      you go, little Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Last night, when we were talking of compliments and of gross speeches,
      Mrs. Thrale most justly said, that nobody could make either like Dr.
      Johnson. &ldquo;Your compliments, sir, are made seldom, but when they are made
      they have an elegance unequalled; but then when you are angry! who dares
      make speeches so bitter and so cruel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Madam, I am always sorry when I make bitter speeches, and I never
      do it, but when I am insufferably vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T-Yes, Sir; but you suffer things to vex you, that nobody else would
      vex at. I am sure I have had my share of scoldings from <i>you</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J-It is true, you have; but you have borne it like an angel, and you
      have been the better for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-That I believe, sir: for I have received more instruction from you
      than from any man, or any book: and the vanity that you should think me
      worth instructing, always overcame the vanity<a href="#linknote-71"
       name="linknoteref-71" id="linknoteref-71">[71]</a> of being found fault
      with. And so you had the scolding, and I the improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-And I am sure both make for the honour of both!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr J.-I think so too. But Mrs. Thrale is a sweet creature, and never
      angry; she has a temper the most delightful of any woman I ever knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-This I can tell you, sir, and without any flattery&mdash;I not
      only bear your reproofs when present, but in almost everything I do in
      your absence, I ask myself whether you would like it, and what you would
      say to it. Yet I believe there is nobody you dispute with oftener than me.
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-But you two are so well established with one another, that you can
      bear a rebuff that would kill a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Yes; but we disputed the same before we were so well established
      with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Oh, sometimes I think I shall die no other death than hearing the
      bitter things he says to others. What he says to myself I can bear,
      because I know how sincerely he is my friend, and that he means to mend
      me; but to others it is cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Why, madam, you often provoke me to say severe things, by
      unreasonable commendation. If you would not call for my praise, I would
      not give you my censure; but it constantly moves my indignation to be
      applied to, to speak well of a thing which I think contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-Well, this I know, whoever I may hear complain of Dr. Johnson's
      severity, I shall always vouch for his kindness, as far as regards myself,
      and his indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Ay, but I hope he will trim you yet, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-I hope not: I should be very sorry to say anything that should vex
      my dear little Burney.
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-If you did, sir, it would vex me more than you can imagine. I should
      sink in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-I remember, sir, when we were travelling in Wales, how you called
      me to account for my civility to the people. 'Madam,' you said, 'let me
      have no more of this idle commendation of nothing. Why is it, that
      whatever you see, and whoever you see, you are to be so indiscriminately
      lavish of praise?' 'Why! I'll tell you, sir,' said I, 'when I am with you
      and Mr. Thrale, and Queeny, I am obliged to be civil for four!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cutter for you! But this I must say, for the honour of both&mdash;Mrs.
      Thrale speaks to Dr. Johnson with as much sincerity, (though with greater
      softness,) as he does to her.

    <h2>
      SUGGESTED HUSBANDS FOR FANNY BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sept. 26</i>&mdash;The present chief sport with Mrs. Thrale is
      disposing of me in the holy state of matrimony, and she offers me whoever
      comes to the house. This was begun by Mrs. Montagu, who, it seems,
      proposed a match for me in my absence, with Sir Joshua Reynolds!&mdash;no
      less a man, I assure you!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was dressing for dinner, Mrs. Thrale told me that Mr. Crutchley was
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo; quoth I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man of very large fortune, who was a ward of Mr. Thrale. Queeny,
      what do you say of him for Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him?&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;no, indeed; what has Miss Burney done to have him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, believe me, a man of his fortune may offer himself anywhere.
      However, I won't recommend him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, ma'am,&rdquo; cried I, with dignity, &ldquo;I reject him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Mr. Crutchley stayed till after breakfast the next morning. I can't
      tell you anything, of him, because I neither like nor dislike him. Mr.
      Crutchley was scarce gone, ere Mr. Smith arrived. Mr. Smith is a second
      cousin to Mr. Thrale, and a modest pretty sort of young man. He stayed
      till Friday morning. When he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you to him, Miss Burney?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale; &ldquo;I'm sure I offer
      you variety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I like him better than Mr. Crutchley, but I don't think I shall pine
      for either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;don't you think Jerry Crutchley very
      much improved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Yes, madam, I think he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Shall he have Miss Burney?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Why, I think not; at least I must know more about him; I Must
      inquire into his connections, his recreations, his employments, and his
      character, from his intimates, before I trust Miss Burney with him. And he
      must come down very handsomely with a settlement. I will not have him left
      to his generosity; for as he will marry her for her wit, and she him for
      his fortune, he ought to bid well, and let him come down with what he
      will, his price will never be equal to her worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-She says she likes Mr. Smith better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Yes, but I won't have her like Mr. Smith without money, better than
      Mr. Crutchley with it. Besides, if she has Crutchley, he will use her
      well, to vindicate his choice. The world, madam, has a reasonable claim
      upon all mankind to account for their conduct; therefore, if with his
      great wealth, he marries a woman who has but little, he will be more
      attentive to display her merit, than if she was equally rich,&mdash;in
      order to show that the woman he has chosen deserves from the world all the
      respect and admiration it can bestow, or that else she would not have been
      his choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-I believe young Smith is the better man.
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-Well, I won't be rash in thinking of either; I will take some time
      for consideration before I fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Why, I don't hold it to be delicate to offer marriage to ladies,
      even in jest, nor do I approve such sort of jocularity; yet for once I
      must break through the rules of decorum, and Propose a match myself for
      Miss Burney. I therefore nominate Sir J&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash;.<a
      href="#linknote-72" name="linknoteref-72" id="linknoteref-72">[72]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-I'll give you my word, sir, you are not the first to say that, for
      my master the other morning, when we were alone, said 'What would I give
      that Sir J&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash; was married to Miss Burney; it
      might restore him to our family.' So spoke his Uncle and guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-He, he! Ha, ha! He, he! Ha, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-That was elegantly said of my master, and nobly said, and not in
      the vulgar way we have been saying it. And madam, where will you find
      another man in trade who will make such a speech&mdash;who will be capable
      of making such a speech? Well, I am glad my master takes so to Miss
      Burney; I would have everybody take to Miss Burney, so as they allow me to
      take to her most! Yet I don't know whether Sir J&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash;
      should have her, neither; I should be afraid for her; I don't think I
      would hand her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-Why, now, what a fine match is here broken off!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, when we were in the library, he asked me very gravely if
      I loved reading?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoth I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you doubt it, sir?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I never see her with a book in her hand. I have
      taken notice that she never has been reading whenever I have come into the
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; quoth I, courageously, &ldquo;I'm always afraid of being caught reading,
      lest I should pass for being studious or affected, and therefore instead
      of making a display of books, I always try to hide them, as is the case at
      this very time, for I have now your 'Life of Waller' under my gloves
      behind me. However, since I am piqued to it, I'll boldly produce my
      voucher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, I put the book on the table, and opened it with a
      flourishing air. And then the laugh was on my side, for he could not help
      making a droll face; and if he had known Kitty Cooke, I would have called
      out, &ldquo;There I had you, my lad!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A STREATHAM DINNER PARTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monday was the day for our great party; and the Doctor came home, at Mrs.
      Thrale's request, to meet them. The party consisted of Mr. C&mdash;, who
      was formerly a timber-merchant, but having amassed a fortune of one
      million of pounds, he has left off business. He is a good-natured busy
      sort of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C&mdash;, his lady, a sort of Mrs. Nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. N&mdash;, another rich business leaver-off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. N&mdash;, his lady; a pretty sort of woman, who was formerly a pupil
      of Dr. Hawkesworth. I had a great deal of talk with her about him, and
      about my favourite miss Kinnaird, whom she knew very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. George and Mr. Thomas N&mdash;, her sons-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. R&mdash;-, of whom I know nothing but that he married into Mr.
      Thrale's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ladd; I ought to have begun with her. I beg her ladyship a thousand
      pardons&mdash;though if she knew my offence, I am sure I should not obtain
      one. She is own sister to Mr. Thrale. She is a tall and stout woman, has
      an air of mingled dignity and haughtiness, both of which wear off in
      conversation. She dresses very youthful and gaily, and attends to her
      person with no little complacency. She appears to me uncultivated in
      knowledge, though an adept in the manners of the world, and all that. She
      chooses to be much more lively than her brother; but liveliness sits as
      awkwardly upon her as her pink ribbons. In talking her over with Mrs.
      Thrale who has a very proper regard for her, but who, I am sure, cannot be
      blind to her faults, she gave me another proof to those I have already of
      the uncontrolled freedom of speech which Dr. Johnson exercised to
      everybody, and which everybody receives quietly from him. Lady Ladd has
      been very handsome, but is now, I think, quite ugly&mdash;at least she has
      the sort of face I like not. She was a little while ago dressed in so
      showy a manner as to attract the doctor's notice, and when he had looked
      at her some time, he broke out aloud into this quotation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;With patches, paint, and jewels on,
     Sure Phillis is not twenty-one
     But if at night you Phillis see,
     The dame at least is forty-three!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I don't recollect the verses exactly, but such was their purport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;Lady Ladd took it very good-naturedly, and
      only said, 'I know enough of that forty-three&mdash;I don't desire to hear
      any more of it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Moss, a pretty girl, who played and sung, to the great fatigue of
      Mrs. Thrale; Mr. Rose Fuller, Mr. Embry, Mr. Seward, Dr. Johnson, the
      three Thrales, and myself, close the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the company divided pretty much into parties, and almost
      everybody walked upon the gravel-walk before the windows. I was going to
      have joined some of them, when Dr. Johnson stopped me, and asked how I
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid, sir,&rdquo; cried I &ldquo;you did not intend to know me again, for you
      have not spoken to me before since your return from town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> dear,&rdquo; cried he, taking both my hands, &ldquo;I was not of <i>you</i>,
      I am so near sighted, and I apprehended making some Mistake.&rdquo; Then drawing
      me very unexpectedly towards him, he actually kissed me!
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, I was a little surprised, having no idea of such facetiousness
      from him, However, I was glad nobody was in the room but Mrs. Thrale, who
      stood close to us, and Mr. Embry, who was lounging on a sofa at the
      furthest end of the room. Mrs. Thrale laughed heartily, and said she hoped
      I was contented with his amends for not knowing me sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after she said she would go and walk with the rest, if she did
      not fear for my reputation in being &ldquo;left with the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, as Mr. Embry is yonder, I think he'll take some care of you,&rdquo;
       she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, madam,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;we shall do very well; but I assure you I
      sha'n't part with Miss Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he held me by both hands; and when Mrs. Thrale went, he drew me a
      chair himself facing the window, close to his own; and thus tete-a-tete we
      continued almost all the evening. I say tete-a-tete, because Mr, Embry
      kept at an humble distance, and offered us no interruption And though Mr.
      Seward soon after came in, he also seated himself at a distant corner, not
      presuming, he said, to break in upon us! Everybody, he added, gave way to
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conversation chiefly was upon the Hebrides, for he always talks to me
      of Scotland, out of sport; and he wished I had been of that tour&mdash;quite
      gravely, I assure you!
    </p>
    <p>
      The P&mdash; family came in to tea. When they were gone Mrs. Thrale
      complained that she was quite worn out with that tiresome silly woman Mrs.
      P&mdash;, who had talked of her family and affairs till she was sick to
      death of hearing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;why do you blame the woman for the only
      sensible thing she could do&mdash;talking of her family and her affairs?
      For how should a woman who is as empty as a drum, talk upon any other
      subject? If you speak to her of the sun, she does not know it rises in the
      east;&mdash;if you speak to her of the moon, she does not know it changes
      at the full;&mdash;if you speak to her of the queen, she does not know she
      is the king's wife.&mdash;how, then, can you blame her for talking of her
      family and affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>

      THE AUTHOR OF &ldquo;EVELINA&rdquo; IN SOCIETY:
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SHE VISITS BRIGHTON AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS.
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Fanny's circle of acquaintance was largely extended in
     1779, in which year she was introduced to Mrs. Horneck and
     her daughter Mary (Goldsmith's &ldquo;Jessamy Bride&rdquo;), to Mr. and
     Mrs. Cholmondeley, to Arthur Murphy, the dramatist, and best
     of all, Richard Brinsley Sheridan and his beautiful wife.
     The Hornecks and the Cholmondeleys she met at one of those
     delightful parties at Sir Joshua Reynolds's house in
     Leicester Square,&mdash;parties composed of the wisest and
     wittiest in English society of the day, though nowhere among
     the guests could there be found a man of more genuine worth
     or more brilliant genius than the mild-mannered host.  Mrs.
     Horneck had been a noted beauty in her younger days, and
     she, as well as her two lovely daughters, had been painted
     by Sir Joshua.  The elder daughter, Catherine (Goldsmith's
     &ldquo;Little Comedy&rdquo;), was now (1779) Mrs. Bunbury, wife of Henry
     Bunbury the caricaturist.  Mary, the younger, was at this
     time about twenty-six years of age, and was subsequently
     married to Colonel Gwynn, whom we shall meet with in Fanny's
     Diary of her Life at Court.  Goldsmith, it is said, had
     loved Mary Horneck, though the ugly little man never
     ventured to tell his love; but when he died, five years
     before her meeting with Fanny, the Jessamy Bride caused his
     coffin to be reopened, and a lock of hair to be cut from the
     dead poet's head.  This lock she treasured until her own
     death, nearly seventy years afterwards.

     Mrs. Sheridan's maiden name was Eliza Anne Linley.  There is
     an interesting notice of her in Fanny's &ldquo;Early Diary&rdquo; for
     the month of April, 1773.  &ldquo;Can I speak of music, and not
     mention Miss Linley?  The town has rung of no other name
     this month. Miss Linley is daughter to a musician of Bath, a
     very sour, ill-bred, severe, and selfish man.  She is
     believed to be very romantic; she has long been very
     celebrated for her singing, though never, till within this
     month, has she been in London.

     &ldquo;She has long been attached to a Mr.  Sheridan, a young man
     of great talents, and very well spoken of, whom it is
     expected she will speedily marry.  She has performed this
     Lent at the Oratorio of Drury-lane, under Mr.  Stanley's
     direction.  The applause and admiration she has met with,
     can only be compared to what is given Mr. Garrick.  The
     whole town seems distracted about her. Every other diversion
     is forsaken.  Miss Linley alone engrosses all eyes, ears,
     hearts.&rdquo;

     The &ldquo;young man of great talents&rdquo; was, when Fanny first met
     him, already renowned as the author of &ldquo;The Rivals&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
     School for Scandal.&rdquo;  His wife's extraordinary beauty has
     been perpetuated in one of Reynolds's masterpieces, in which
     she is represented as St. Cecilia, sitting at an organ.  Her
     father seems to have fully deserved the character which
     Fanny gives him. In 1772 Eliza, then only nineteen, ran away
     to France with young Sheridan, who was just of age, and, it
     is reported, was privately married to him at the time.  They
     were pursued, however, by old Linley, and Eliza was brought
     back, to become the rage of the town as a singer.  Her lover
     married her openly in April, 1773, and thenceforward she
     sang no more in public.

     Fanny's account of her visits to Tunbridge Wells and
     Brighton will recall, to readers of her novels, the
     delightfully humorous descriptions of the society at those
     fashionable resorts, in &ldquo;Camilla&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Wanderer.&rdquo; Mount
     Ephraim, at Tunbridge Wells, where Sophy Streatfield
     resided, will be recognized as the scene of the accident in
     which Camilla's life is saved by Sir Sedley Clarendel.&mdash;ED.]

    <h2>
      A QUEER ADVENTURE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      St. Martin's Street, January.
    </h3>
    <p>
      On Thursday, I had another adventure, and one that has made me grin ever
      since. A gentleman inquiring for my father, was asked into the parlour.
      The then inhabitants were only my mother and me. In entered a square old
      gentleman, well-wigged, formal, grave and important. He seated himself. My
      mother asked if he had any message for my father? &ldquo;No, none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he regarded me with a certain dry kind of attention for some time;
      after which, turning suddenly to my mother, he demanded,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, ma'am, is this your daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! this is Evelina, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; cried I, staring at him, and glad none of you were in the way
      to say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; repeated he, incredulous; &ldquo;is not your name Evelina, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, no, sir,&rdquo; again quoth I, staring harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am,&rdquo; cried he, drily; &ldquo;I beg your pardon! I had understood your name
      was Evelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon: after, he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he put down his card, who should it prove but Dr. Franklin.<a

    <h2>
      AN EVENING AT SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS'S
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DEMONSTRATIVE &ldquo;EVELINA&rdquo; ENTHUSIAST.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now to this grand visit, which was become more tremendous than ever
      because of the pamphlet <a href="#linknote-74" name="linknoteref-74"
       id="linknoteref-74">[74]</a> business, and I felt almost ashamed to see
      Sir Joshua, and could not but conclude he would think of it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother, who changed her mind, came with me. My father promised to come
      before the Opera was half over.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the Miss Palmers alone. We were, for near an hour, quite easy,
      chatty, and comfortable; no pointed speech was made, and no starer
      entered. But when I asked the elder Miss Palmer if she would allow me to
      look at some of her drawings, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you will let me see something of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of mine?&rdquo; quoth I. &ldquo;Oh! I have nothing to show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you have; you must have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; I don't draw at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw? No, but I mean some of your writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I never write&mdash;except letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters? those are the very things I want to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not such as you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh now, don't say so; I am sure you are about something and if you would
      but show me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I am about nothing&mdash;I am quite out of conceit with writing.&rdquo;
       I had my thoughts full of the vile Warley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You out of conceit?&rdquo; exclaimed she; &ldquo;nay, then, if you are, who should be
      otherwise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then, Mrs. and Miss Horneck were announced. You may suppose I thought
      directly of the one hundred and sixty miles<a href="#linknote-75"
       name="linknoteref-75" id="linknoteref-75">[75]</a>&mdash;and may take it
      for granted I looked them very boldly in the face! Mrs. Horneck seated
      herself by my mother. Miss Palmer introduced me to her and her daughter,
      who seated herself next me; but not one word passed between us!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Horneck, as I found in the course of the evening, is an exceedingly
      sensible, well-bred woman. Her daughter is very beautiful; but was
      low-spirited and silent during the whole visit. She was, indeed, very
      unhappy, as Miss Palmer informed me, upon account of some ill news she had
      lately heard of the affairs of a gentleman to whom she is shortly to be
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after came a whole troop, consisting of Mr. Cholmondeley!&mdash;perilous
      name!&mdash;Miss Cholmondeley, and Miss Fanny Cholmondeley, his daughters,
      and Miss Forrest. Mrs. Cholmondeley, I found, was engaged elsewhere, but
      soon expected.<a href="#linknote-76" name="linknoteref-76"
       id="linknoteref-76">[76]</a> Now here was a trick of Sir Joshua, to make
      me meet all these people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cholmondeley is a clergyman; nothing shining either in person or
      manners, but rather somewhat grim in the first, and glum in the last. Yet
      he appears to have humour himself, and to enjoy it much in others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cholmondeley I saw too little of to mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fanny Cholmondeley is a rather pretty, pale girl; very young and
      inartificial, and though tall and grown up, treated by her family as a
      child, and seemingly well content to really think herself such. She
      followed me whichever way I turned, and though she was too modest to
      stare, never ceased watching me the whole evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Forrest is an immensely tall and not handsome young woman. Further I
      know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came my father, all gaiety and spirits. Then Mr. William Burke.<a
      href="#linknote-77" name="linknoteref-77" id="linknoteref-77">[77]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, Sir Joshua returned home. He paid his compliments to
      everybody, and then brought a chair next mine, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were afraid to come among us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don't know if I wrote to you a speech to that purpose, which I made to
      the Miss Palmers? and which, I suppose, they had repeated to him. He went
      on, saying I might as well fear hobgoblins, and that I had only to hold up
      my head to be above them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this address, his behaviour was exactly what my wishes would have
      dictated to him, for my own ease and quietness; for he never once even
      alluded to my book, but conversed rationally, gaily, and serenely: and so
      I became more comfortable than I had been ever since the first entrance of
      company. Our confab was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. King; a
      gentleman who is, it seems, for ever with the Burkes;&mdash;and presently
      Lord Palmerston<a href="#linknote-78" name="linknoteref-78"
       id="linknoteref-78">[78]</a> was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, while this was going forward, a violent rapping bespoke, I was sure,
      Mrs. Cholmondeley, and I ran from the standers, and turning my back
      against the door, looked over Miss Palmer's cards; for you may well
      imagine, I was really in a tremor at a meeting which so long has been in
      agitation, and with the person who, of all persons, has been most warm and
      enthusiastic for my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not, however, been in the room half an instant, ere my father came
      up to me, and tapping me on the shoulder, said, &ldquo;Fanny, here's a lady who
      wishes to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I curtsied in silence, she too curtsied, and fixed her eyes full on my
      face: and then tapping me with her fan, she cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, you must not look grave upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, I te-he'd; she now looked at me yet more earnestly, and, after
      an odd silence, said, abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be!&mdash;tell me, though, is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only simper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you tell me?&mdash;but it can't be&mdash;I don't believe it!&mdash;no,
      you are an impostor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua and Lord Palmerston were both at her side&mdash;oh, how notably
      silly must I look! She again repeated her question of &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; and I
      again affected not to understand her: and then Sir Joshua, taking hold on
      her arm, attempted to pull her away, saying
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Mrs. Cholmondeley, I won't have her overpowered here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I love Sir Joshua much for this. But Mrs. Cholmondeley, turning to him,
      said, with quickness and vehemence:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I a'n't going to kill her! don't be afraid, I sha'n't compliment
      her!&mdash;I can't, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, taking my hand, she led me through them all, to another part of the
      room, where again she examined my phiz, and viewed and reviewed my whole
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do tell me; is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, ma'am?&mdash;I don't-I don't know what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho! what,&mdash;why you know what: in short, can you read? and can you
      write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I have suspected it was a trick, some time,
      and now I am sure of it. You are too young by half!&mdash;it can't be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and would have got away, but she would not let me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;one thing you must, at least, tell me;&mdash;are you
      very conceited? Come, answer me,&rdquo; continued she. &ldquo;You won't? Mrs. Burney,
      Dr. Burney,&mdash;come here,&mdash;tell me if she is not very conceited?&mdash;if
      she is not eat up with conceit by this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both pleased to answer &ldquo;Not half enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed she, &ldquo;that is the most wonderful part of all! Why, that
      is yet more extraordinary than writing the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then got away from her, and again looked over Miss Palmer's cards: but
      she was after me in a minute,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried she, aloud, &ldquo;do you know any thing of this
      game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; repeated she, &ldquo;ma foi, that's pity!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-79"
       name="linknoteref-79" id="linknoteref-79">[79]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This raised such a laugh, I was forced to move on; yet everybody seemed to
      be afraid to laugh, too, and studying to be delicate, as if they had been
      cautioned; which, I have since found, was really the case, and by Sir
      Joshua himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, however, she was at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What game do you like, Miss Burney?&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I play at none, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Pardie, I wonder at that! Did you ever know such a toad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I moved on, and got behind Mr. W. Burke, who, turning round to me,
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not very politic in us, Miss Burney, to play at cards, and have
      you listen to our follies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There's for you! I am to pass for a censoress now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cholmondeley hunted me quite round the card-table, from chair to
      chair, repeating various speeches of Madame Duval; and when, at last, I
      got behind a sofa, out of her reach, she called out aloud, &ldquo;Polly, Polly!
      only think! Miss has danced with a Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, contriving to again get near me, she began flirting her
      fan, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Well, miss, I have had a beau, I assure you! ay, and
      a very pretty beau too, though I don't know if his lodgings were so
      prettily furnished, and everything, as Mr. Smith's."<a href="#linknote-80"
       name="linknoteref-80" id="linknoteref-80">[80]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, applying to Mr. Cholmondeley, she said, &ldquo;Pray, sir, what is become
      of my lottery ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardie&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;you don't know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had now again made off, and, after much rambling, I at last seated
      myself near the card-table: but Mrs. Cholmondeley was after me in a
      minute, and drew a chair next mine. I now found it impossible to escape,
      and therefore forced myself to sit still. Lord Palmerston and Sir Joshua,
      in a few moments, seated themselves by us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must now write dialogue-fashion, to avoid the enormous length of Mrs.
      C.'s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-I have been very ill; monstrous ill indeed or else I should have
      been at your house long ago. Sir Joshua, pray how do you do? you know, I
      suppose, that I don't come, to see you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua could only laugh, though this was her first address to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-Pray, miss, what's your name?
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-Frances, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-Fanny? Well, all the Fanny's are excellent and yet, my name is
      Mary! Pray, Miss Palmers, how are you?&mdash;though I hardly know if I
      shall speak to you to-night, I thought I should have never got here! I
      have been so out of humour with the people for keeping me. If you but
      knew, cried I, to whom I am going to-night, and who I shall see to-night,
      you would not dare keep me muzzing here!
    </p>
    <p>
      During all these pointed speeches, her penetrating eyes were fixed upon
      me; and what could I do?&mdash;what, indeed, could anybody do, but colour
      and simper?&mdash;all the company watching us, though all, very
      delicately, avoided joining the confab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-My Lord Palmerston, I was told to-night that nobody could see your
      lordship for me, for that you supped at my house every night. Dear, bless
      me, no! cried I, not every night! and I looked as confused as I was able;
      but I am afraid I did not blush, though I tried hard for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, turning to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mr. What-d'ye-call-him, in Fleet-street, is a mighty silly fellow;&mdash;perhaps
      you don't know who I mean?&mdash;one T. Lowndes,&mdash;but maybe you don't
      know such a person?
    </p>
    <p>
      FB.-No, indeed, I do not!&mdash;that I can safely say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-I could get nothing from him: but I told him I hoped he gave a
      good price; and he answered me that he always did things genteel. What
      trouble and tagging we had! Mr. [I cannot recollect the name she
      mentioned] laid a wager the writer was a man:&mdash;I said I was sure it
      was a woman: but now we are both out; for it's a girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this comical, queer, flighty, whimsical manner she ran on, till we were
      summoned to supper; for we were not allowed to break up before: and then,
      when Sir Joshua and almost everybody was gone down stairs, she changed her
      tone, and, with a face and voice both grave, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Burney, you must give me leave to say one thing to you; yet,
      perhaps you won't, neither, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it is, that I admire you more than any human being and that I can't
      help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly rising, she hurried down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were upon the stairs, I heard Miss Palmer say to Miss Fanny
      Cholmondeley, &ldquo;Well, you don't find Miss Burney quite so tremendous as you
      expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua made me sit next him at supper; Mr. William Burke was at my
      other side; though, afterwards, I lost the knight of Plimton,<a
      href="#linknote-81" name="linknoteref-81" id="linknoteref-81">[81]</a>
      who, as he eats no suppers, made way for Mr. Gwatkin,<a href="#linknote-82"
       name="linknoteref-82" id="linknoteref-82">[82]</a> and, as the table was
      crowded, himself stood at the fire. He was extremely polite and flattering
      in his manners to me, and entirely avoided all mention or hint at
      &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; the whole evening: indeed, I think I have met more scrupulous
      delicacy from Sir Joshua than from anybody, although I have heard more of
      his approbation than of almost any other person's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. W. Burke was immensely attentive at table; but, lest he should be
      thought a Mr. Smith for his pains, he took care, whoever he helped, to
      add, &ldquo;You know I am all for the ladies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad I was not next Mrs. Cholmondeley; but she frequently, and very
      provokingly, addressed herself to me; once she called out aloud, &ldquo;Pray,
      Miss Burney, is there anything new coming out?&rdquo; And another time, &ldquo;Well, I
      wish people who can entertain me would entertain me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These sort of pointed speeches are almost worse than direct attacks, for
      there is no knowing how to look, or what to say, especially where the eyes
      of a whole company mark the object for Whom they are meant. To the last of
      these speeches I made no sort of answer but Sir Joshua very good-naturedly
      turned it from me, by saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let everyone do what they can in their different ways; do you begin
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't!&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;I have tried, but I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so you think, then,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;that all the world is made only to
      entertain you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very lively dialogue ensued. But I grow tired of writing. One thing,
      however, I must mention, which, at the time, frightened me wofully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Sir Joshua,&rdquo; asked Lord Palmerston, &ldquo;what is this 'Warley' that is
      just come out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was not this a cruel question? I felt in such a twitter!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;but the reviewers, my lord, speak very
      well of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-Who wrote it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua.-Mr. Huddisford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-O! I don't like it at all, then! Huddisford what a name! Miss
      Burney, pray can you conceive anything of such a name as Huddisford?
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not speak a word, and I dare say I looked no-how. But was it not
      an unlucky reference to me? Sir Joshua attempted a kind of vindication of
      him; but Lord Palmerston said, drily,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Sir Joshua, it is dedicated to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your servant! Is it so?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cholmondeley; &ldquo;then you need say
      no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua laughed, and the subject, to my great relief, was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we broke up to depart, which was not till near two in the morning,
      Mrs. Cholmondeley went up to my mother, and begged her permission to visit
      in St. Martin's Street. Then, as she left the room, she said to me, with a
      droll sort of threatening look,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not got rid of me yet, I have been forcing myself into your
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must own I was not at all displeased at this, as I had very much and
      very reasonably feared that she would have been by then as sick of me from
      disappointment, as she was before eager for me from curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came away, Offy Palmer, laughing, said to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this will be a breaking-in to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;if I had known of your party!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have been sick in bed, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would not answer &ldquo;No,&rdquo; yet I was glad it was over. And so concludeth
      this memorable evening.

    <h2>
      FANNY BURNEY'S INTRODUCTION TO SHERIDAN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Monday last, my father sent a note to Mrs. Cholmondeley, to propose our
      waiting on her the Wednesday following; she accepted the proposal, and
      accordingly on Wednesday evening, my father, mother, and self went to
      Hertford-street. I should have told you that Mrs. Cholmondeley, when my
      father some time ago called on her, sent me a message, that if I would go
      to see her, I should not again be stared at or worried; and she
      acknowledged that my visit at Sir Joshua's had been a formidable one, and
      that I was watched the whole evening; but that upon the whole, the company
      behaved extremely well, for they only ogled!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we were received by Mrs. Cholmondeley with great politeness, and in
      a manner that showed she intended to throw aside Madame Duval, and to
      conduct herself towards me in a new style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Misses Cholmondeley and Miss Forrest were with her; but who else
      think you?&mdash;why Mrs. Sheridan! I was absolutely charmed at the sight
      of her. I think her quite as beautiful as ever, and even more captivating;
      for she has now a look of ease and happiness that animates her whole face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Linley was with her; she is very handsome, but nothing near her
      sister: the elegance of Mrs. Sheridan's beauty is unequalled by any I ever
      saw, except Mrs. Crewe.<a href="#linknote-83" name="linknoteref-83"
       id="linknoteref-83">[83]</a> I was pleased with her in all respects. She
      is much more lively and agreeable than I had any idea of finding her; she
      was very gay, and very unaffected, and totally free from airs of any kind.
      Miss Linley was very much out of spirits; she did not speak three words
      the whole evening, and looked wholly unmoved at all that passed. Indeed,
      she appeared to be heavy and inanimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cholmondeley sat next me. She is determined, I believe, to make me
      like her: and she will, I believe, have full success; for she is very
      clever, very entertaining, and very much unlike anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first subject started was the Opera, and all joined in the praise of
      Pacchierotti.<a href="#linknote-84" name="linknoteref-84"
       id="linknoteref-84">[84]</a> Mrs. Sheridan declared she could not hear him
      without tears, and that he was the first Italian singer who ever affected
      her to such a degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they talked of the intended marriage of the Duke of Dorset, to Miss
      Cumberland, and many ridiculous anecdotes were related. The conversation
      naturally fell upon Mr. Cumberland<a href="#linknote-85"
       name="linknoteref-85" id="linknoteref-85">[85]</a>, and he was finely cut
      up!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man is that!&rdquo; said Mrs. Cholmondeley: &ldquo;I cannot bear him&mdash;so
      querulous, so dissatisfied, so determined to like nobody, and nothing but
      himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, Miss More<a href="#linknote-86" name="linknoteref-86"
       id="linknoteref-86">[86]</a> was mentioned and I was asked what I thought
      of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be formal with me if you are, I sha'n't like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no hope that you will any way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fie! fie! but as to Miss More&mdash;I don't like her at all: that is,
      I detest her! She does nothing but flatter and fawn; and then she thinks
      ill of nobody. Oh, there's no supporting the company of professed
      flatterers. She gives me such doses of it, that I cannot endure her; but I
      always sit still and make no answer, but receive it as if I thought it my
      due: that is the only way to quiet her.<a href="#linknote-87"
       name="linknoteref-87" id="linknoteref-87">[87]</a> She is really
      detestable. I hope, Miss Burney, you don't think I admire all geniuses?
      The only person I flatter,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;is Garrick; and he likes it so
      much, that it pays one by the spirits it gives him. Other people that I
      like, I dare not flatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rat-tat-tat-tat ensued, and the Earl of Harcourt was announced. When he
      had paid his compliments to Mrs. Cholmondeley, speaking of the lady from
      whose house he was just come, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Vesey<a href="#linknote-88" name="linknoteref-88" id="linknoteref-88">[88]</a>
      Is vastly agreeable, but her fear of ceremony is really troublesome; for
      her eagerness to break a circle is such, that she insists upon everybody's
      sitting with their backs one to another; that is, the chairs are drawn
      into little parties of three together, in a confused manner, all over the
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;they may have the pleasure of caballing and
      cutting up one another, even in the same room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like the notion of all things,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cholmondeley, &ldquo;I shall
      certainly adopt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she drew her chair into the middle of our circle. Lord Harcourt
      turned his round, and his back to most of us, and my father did the same.
      You can't imagine a more absurd sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door opened, and Mr. Sheridan entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was I not in luck? Not that I believe the meeting was accidental; but I
      had more wished to meet him and his wife than any people I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not endure my ridiculous situation, but replaced myself in an
      orderly manner immediately. Mr. Sheridan stared at the mall, and Mrs.
      Cholmondeley said she intended it as a hint for a comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sheridan has a very fine figure, and a good though I don't think a
      handsome face. He is tall, and very upright, and his appearance and
      address are at once manly and fashionable, without the smallest tincture
      of foppery or modish graces. In short, I like him vastly, and think him
      every way worthy his beautiful companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let me tell you what I know will give you as much pleasure as it gave
      me,&mdash;that, by all I Could observe in the course of the evening, and
      we stayed very late, they are extremly happy in each other: he evidently
      adores her, and she as evidently idolises him. The world has by no means
      done him justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had paid his compliments to all his acquaintance, he went behind
      the sofa on which Mrs. Sheridan and Miss Offy Cholmondeley were seated,
      and entered into earnest conversation with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon Lord Harcourt's again paying Mrs. Cholmondeley some compliment, she
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lord, after this I shall be quite sublime for some days! I
      shan't descend into common life till&mdash;till Saturday. And then I shall
      drop into the vulgar style&mdash;I shall be in the ma foi way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do really believe she could not resist this, for she had seemed
      determined to be quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next there was a rat-tat, Mrs. Cholmondeley and Lord Harcourt, and my
      father again, at the command of the former, moved into the middle of the
      room, and then Sir Joshua Reynolds and Dr. Warton<a href="#linknote-89"
       name="linknoteref-89" id="linknoteref-89">[89]</a> entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      No further company came. You may imagine there was a general roar at the
      breaking of the circle, and when they got into order, Mr. Sheridan seated
      himself in the place Mrs. Cholmondeley had left, between my father and
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I must tell you a little conversation which I did not hear myself
      till I came home; it was between Mr. Sheridan and my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Burney,&rdquo; cried the former, &ldquo;have you no older daughters? Can this
      possibly be the authoress of 'Evelina'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he said abundance of fine things, and begged my father to
      introduce him to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it will be a very formidable thing to her,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;to be
      introduced to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, by and by,&rdquo; returned he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after this, my eyes happening to meet his, he waived the
      ceremony of introduction, and in a low voice said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been telling Dr. Burney that I have long expected to see in Miss
      Burney a lady of the gravest appearance, with the quickest parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was never much more astonished than at this unexpected address, as among
      all my numerous puffers the name of Sheridan has never reached me, and I
      did really imagine he had never deigned to look at my trash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I could make no verbal answer, and he proceeded then to speak of
      &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; in terms of the highest praise but I was in such a ferment from
      surprise, not to say pleasure that I have no recollection of his
      expressions. I only remember telling him that I was much amazed he had
      spared time to read it, and that he repeatedly called it a most surprising
      book; and sometime after he added, &ldquo;But I hope, Miss Burney, you don't
      intend to throw away your pen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should take care, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what you say: for you know not what
      weight it may have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wished it might have any, he said, and soon after turned again to my
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I protest, since the approbation of the Streathamites, I have met with
      none so flattering to me as this of Mr. Sheridan, in so very unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Mrs. Cholmondeley was making much sport by wishing for an
      acrostic on her name. She said she had several times begged for one in
      vain, and began to entertain thoughts of writing one herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am very famous for my rhymes, though I never made a
      line of poetry in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An acrostic on your name,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheridan, &ldquo;would be a very formidable
      task; it must be so long that I think it should be divided into cantos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried Sir Joshua, who was now reseated, &ldquo;Are not you a
      writer of verses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs C.-O don't believe her. I have made a resolution not to believe
      anything she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-I think a lady should not write verses till she is past receiving
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-(rising and stalking majestically towards him).-Mr. Sheridan,
      pray, sir, what may you mean by this insinuation; did I not say I writ
      verses?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-Oh, but you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. C.-Say no more, sir! You have made your meaning but too plain
      already. There now, I think that's a speech for a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, Sir Joshua, returning to his standing-place, entered into
      confab with Miss Linley and your slave upon various matters, during which
      Mr. Sheridan, joining us, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Joshua, I have been telling Miss Burney that she must not suffer her
      pen to lie idle&mdash;ought she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir J.-No, indeed, ought she not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-Do you then, Sir Joshua, persuade her. But perhaps you have begun
      something? May we ask? Will you answer a question candidly?
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-I don't know, but as candidly as Mrs. Candour I think I certainly
      shall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-What then are you about now?
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-Why, twirling my fan, I think!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-No, no; but what are you about at home? However, it is not a fair
      question, so I won't press it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he looked very inquisitive; but I was glad to get off without any
      downright answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir J.-Anything in the dialogue way, I think, she must succeed in; and I
      am sure invention will not be wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-No, indeed; I think, and say, she should write a comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIr J.-I am sure I think so; and hope she will.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only answer by incredulous exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider&rdquo; continued Sir Joshua, &ldquo;you have already had all the applause
      and fame you can have given you in the closet; but the acclamation of a
      theatre will be new to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he put down his trumpet, and began a violent clapping of his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I actually shook from head to foot! I felt myself already in Drury Lane,
      amidst the hubbub of a first night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;there may be a noise, but it will be just the
      reverse.&rdquo; And I returned his salute with a hissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sheridan joined Sir Joshua very warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;you should not run on so, you don't know what mischief
      you may do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-I wish I may&mdash;I shall be very glad to be accessory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir J.-She has, certainly, something of a knack at characters; where she
      got it I don't know, and how she got it, I can't imagine; but she
      certainly has it. And to throw it away is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-Oh, she won't, she will write a comedy, she has promised me she
      will!
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-Oh! if you both run on in this manner, I shall&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to say get under the chair, but Mr. Sheridan, interrupting me
      with a laugh, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set about one? very well, that's right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried Sir Joshua, &ldquo;that's very right. And You (to Mr. Sheridan)
      would take anything of hers, would you not? unsight, unseen?"<a
      href="#linknote-90" name="linknoteref-90" id="linknoteref-90">[90]</a>
      What a point blank question! who but Sir Joshua would have ventured it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheridan, with quickness, &ldquo;and make her a bow and my
      best thanks into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now my dear Susy, tell me, did you ever hear the fellow to such a speech
      as this! it was all I could do to sit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sheridan,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;are you not mocking me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, upon my honour! this is what I have meditated to say to you the first
      time I should have the pleasure of seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, as Mrs. Thrale says, if folks are to be spoilt, there is
      nothing in the world so pleasant as spoiling! But I was never so much
      astonished, and seldom have been so much delighted, as by this attack of
      Mr. Sheridan. Afterwards he took my father aside, and formally repeated
      his opinion that I should write for the stage, and his desire to see my
      play, with encomiums the most flattering of &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, my dear Susy, if I should attempt the stage, I think I may be
      fairly acquitted of presumption, and however I may fall, that I was
      strongly pressed to try by Mrs. Thrale, and by Mr. Sheridan, the most
      successful and powerful of all dramatic living authors, will abundantly
      excuse my temerity.

    <h2>
      AN ARISTOCRATIC RADICAL OF THE LAST CENTURY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Streatham, February</i>.&mdash;I have been here so long, <i>My</i>
      dearest Susan, Without writing a word, that now I hardly know where or how
      to begin, But I will try to draw up a concise account of what has passed
      for this last fortnight, and then endeavour to be more minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnson vied with each other in the kindness of their
      reception of me. Mr. Thrale was, as usual at first, cold and quiet, but
      soon, as usual also, warmed into sociality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Sir Philip Jennings Clerke came. He is not at all a man of
      letters, but extremely well-bred, nay, elegant, in his manners, and
      sensible and agreeable in his conversation. He is a professed minority
      man, and very active and zealous in the opposition. He had, when I came, a
      bill in agitation concerning contractors&mdash;too long a matter to
      explain upon paper&mdash;but which was levelled against bribery and
      corruption in the ministry, and which he was to make a motion upon in The
      House of Commons the next week.<a href="#linknote-91" name="linknoteref-91"
       id="linknoteref-91">[91]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of such different principles as Dr. Johnson and Sir Philip <i>you</i>
      may imagine, can not have much sympathy or cordiality in their political
      debates; however, the very superior abilities of the former, and the
      remarkable good breeding of the latter have kept both upon good terms;
      though they have had several arguments, in which each has exerted his
      utmost force for conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heads of one of their debates I must try to remember, because I should
      be sorry to forget. Sir Philip explained his bill; Dr. Johnson at first
      scoffed at it; Mr. Thrale betted a guinea the motion would not pass, and
      Sir Philip, that he should divide a hundred and fifty upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Philip, addressing himself to Mrs. Thrale, hoped she would not suffer
      the Tories to warp her judgment, and told me he hoped my father had not
      tainted my principles; and then he further explained his bill, and indeed
      made it appear so equitable, that Mrs. Thrale gave in to it, and wished
      her husband to vote for it. He still bung back; but, to our general
      surprise, Dr. Johnson having made more particular inquiries into its
      merits, first softened towards it, and then declared it a very rational
      and fair bill, and joined with Mrs. Thrale in soliciting Mr. Thrale's
      vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Philip was, and with very good reason, quite delighted. He opened upon
      politics more amply, and freely declared his opinions, which were so
      strongly against the government, and so much bordering upon the republican
      principles, that Dr. Johnson suddenly took fire; he called back his
      recantation begged Mr. Thrale not to vote for Sir Philip's bill, and grew
      very animated against his antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bill,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ought to be opposed by all honest men! in itself,
      and considered simply it is equitable, and I would forward it; but when we
      find what a faction it is to support and encourage, it ought not to be
      listened to. All men should oppose it who do not wish well to sedition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These, and several other expressions yet more strong, he made use of; and
      had Sir Philip had less unalterable politeness, I believe they would have
      had a vehement quarrel. He maintained his ground, however, with calmness
      and steadiness, though he had neither argument nor wit at all equal to
      such an opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson pursued him with unabating vigour and dexterity, and at
      length, though he could not convince, he so entirely baffled him, that Sir
      Philip was self-compelled to be quiet&mdash;which, with a very good grace,
      he confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson then, recollecting himself, and thinking, as he owned
      afterwards, that the dispute grew too serious, with a skill all his own,
      suddenly and unexpectedly turned it to burlesque; and taking Sir Philip by
      the hand at the moment we arose after supper, and were separating for the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Philip,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are too liberal a man for the party to which
      you belong; I shall have much pride in the honour of converting you; for I
      really believe, if you were not spoiled by bad company, the spirit of
      faction would not have possessed you. Go, then, sir, to the House, but
      make not your motion! Give up your bill, and surprise the world by turning
      to the side of truth and reason. Rise, sir, when they least expect you,
      and address your fellow-patriots to this purpose:&mdash;'Gentlemen, I
      have, for many a weary day, been deceived and seduced by you. I have now
      opened my eyes; I see that you are all scoundrels&mdash;the subversion of
      all government is your aim. Gentlemen, I will no longer herd among rascals
      in whose infamy my name and character must be included. I therefore
      renounce you all, gentlemen, as you deserve to be renounced.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, shaking his hand heartily, he added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, sir, go to bed; meditate upon this recantation, and rise in the
      morning a more honest man than you laid down.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MR. MURPHY, THE DRAMATIST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Thursday, while my dear father was here, who should be announced but
      Mr. Murphy;<a href="#linknote-93" name="linknoteref-93" id="linknoteref-93">[93]</a>
      the man of all other strangers to me whom I most longed to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is tall and well made, has a very gentlemanlike appearance, and a
      quietness of manner upon his first address that, to me, is very pleasing.
      His face looks sensible, and his deportment is perfectly easy and polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had been welcomed by Mrs. Thrale, and had gone through the
      reception-salutations of Dr. Johnson and my father, Mrs. Thrale, advancing
      to me, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here is a lady I must introduce to you, Mr. Murphy here is another F.
      B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried he, taking my hand; &ldquo;is this a sister of Miss Brown's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; this is Miss Burney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried he, staring; &ldquo;is this&mdash;is this&mdash;this is not the
      lady that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it is,&rdquo; answered she, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, you don't say so? You don't mean the lady that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes yes I do; no less a lady, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then said he was very glad of the honour of seeing me. I sneaked away.
      When we came upstairs, Mrs. Thrale charged me to make myself agreeable to
      Mr. Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be of use to you, in what I am most eager for, your writing a
      play: he knows stage business so well; and if you but take a fancy to one
      another, he may be more able to serve you than all of us put together. My
      ambition is, that Johnson should write your prologue, and Murphy your
      epilogue, then I shall be quite happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At tea-time, when I went into the library, I found Johnson reading, and
      Mrs. Thrale in close conference with Mr. Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I,&rdquo; said Mr. Murphy, looking very archly, &ldquo;had written a certain book&mdash;a
      book I won't name, but a book I have lately read&mdash;I would next write
      a comedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, colouring with pleasure; &ldquo;you think so too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed; I thought so while I was reading it; it struck me
      repeatedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look at me, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;for this is no doing
      of mine. Well, I wonder what Miss Burney will do twenty years hence, when
      she can blush no more; for now she can never hear the name of her book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. M.-Nay, I name no book; at least no author: how can I, for I don't
      know the author; there is no name given to it: I only say, whoever wrote
      that book ought to write a comedy. Dr. Johnson might write it for aught I
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      F. B.-Oh, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. M.-Nay, I have often told him he does not know his own strength, or he
      would write a comedy, and so I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J. (laughing)&mdash;Suppose Burney and I begin together?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. M.-Ah, I wish you would! I wish you would Beaumont and Fletcher us!
    </p>
    <p>
      F.B.-My father asked me, this morning, how my head stood. If he should
      have asked me this evening, I don't know what answer I must have made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. M.-I have no wish to turn anybody's head: I speak what I really think;&mdash;comedy
      is the forte of that book. I laughed over it most violently: and if the
      author&mdash;I won't say who [all the time looking away from me]&mdash;will
      write a comedy I will most readily, and with great pleasure, give any
      advice or assistance in my power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now you are a sweet man!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, who looked ready to
      kiss him. &ldquo;Did not I tell you, Miss Burney, that Mr. Murphy was the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. M.-All I can do, I shall be very happy to do; and at least I will
      undertake to say I can tell what the sovereigns of the upper gallery will
      bear: for they are the most formidable part of an audience. I have had so
      much experience in this sort of work, that I believe I can always tell
      what will be hissed at least. And if Miss Burney will write, and will show
      me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Come, come, have done with this now; why should you overpower her?
      Let's have no more of it. I don't mean to dissent from what you say; I
      think well of it, and approve of it; but you have said enough of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murphy, who equally loves and reverences Dr. Johnson, instantly
      changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, at night, I asked Dr. Johnson if he would permit me to take a
      great liberty with him? He assented with the most encouraging smile. And
      then I said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sir, you heard part of what passed between Mr. Murphy and me
      the other evening, concerning&mdash;a comedy. Now, if I should make such
      an attempt, would you be so good as to allow me, any time before
      Michaelmas, to put it in the coach, for you to look over as you go to
      town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, my dear!&mdash;What, have you begun a comedy then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him how the affair stood. He then gave me advice which just
      accorded with my wishes, viz., not to make known that I had any such
      intention; to keep my own counsel; not to whisper even the name of it; to
      raise no expectations, which were always prejudicial, and finally, to have
      it performed while the town knew nothing of whose it was. I readily
      assured him of my hearty concurrence in his opinion; but he somewhat
      distressed me when I told him that Mr. Murphy must be in my confidence, as
      he had offered his services, by desiring he might be the last to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I shall do, I know not, for he has, himself, begged to be the first.
      Mrs. Thrale, however, shall guide me between them. He spoke highly of Mr.
      Murphy, too, for he really loves him. He said he would not have it in the
      coach, but I should read it to him; however, I could sooner drown or hang!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I would have offered some apology for the attempt, he stopt me, and
      desired I would never make any.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if it succeeds, it makes its own apology, if not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;I cannot do worse than Dr. Goldsmith, when his play<a
      href="#linknote-94" name="linknoteref-94" id="linknoteref-94">[94]</a>
      failed,&mdash;go home and cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, but told me, repeatedly (I mean twice, which, for him, is very
      remarkable), that I might depend upon all the service in his power; and,
      he added, it would be well to make Murphy the last judge, &ldquo;for he knows
      the stage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am quite ignorant of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, grasping my hand with the most affectionate warmth, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you success! I wish you well! my dear little Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, at length, I told him I could stay no longer, and bid him good
      night, he said, &ldquo;There is none like you, my dear little Burney! there is
      none like you!&mdash;good night, my darling!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A BEAUTY WEEPING AT WILL,
    </h2>
    <p>
      I find Miss Streatfield <a href="#linknote-95" name="linknoteref-95"
       id="linknoteref-95">[95]</a>a very amiable girl, and extremely handsome;
      not so wise as I expected, but very well; however, had she not chanced to
      have had so uncommon an education, with respect to literature or learning,
      I believe she would not have made her way among the wits by the force of
      her natural parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Seward, you know, told me that she had tears at command, and I begin
      to think so too, for when Mrs. Thrale, who had previously told me I should
      see her cry, began coaxing her to stay, and saying, &ldquo;If you go, I shall
      know you don't love me so well as Lady Gresham,&rdquo;&mdash;she did cry, not
      loud indeed, nor much, but the tears came into her eyes, and rolled down
      her fine cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come hither, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;come and see Miss
      Streatfield cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought it a mere badinage. I went to them, but when I saw real tears, I
      was shocked, and saying &ldquo;No, I won't look at her,&rdquo; ran away frightened,
      lest she should think I laughed at her, which Mrs. Thrale did so openly,
      that, as I told her, had she served me so, I should have been affronted
      with her ever after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Streatfield, however, whether from a sweetness not to be ruffled, or
      from not perceiving there was any room for taking offence, gently wiped
      her eyes, and was perfectly composed!

    <h2>
      MR. MURPHY'S CONCERN REGARDING FANNY BURNEY'S COMEDY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Streatham, May, Friday</i>. Once more, my dearest Susy, I will attempt
      journalising, and endeavour, according to my promise, to keep up something
      of the kind during our absence, however brief and curtailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, while Mrs. Thrale was chatting with me in my room, we saw Mr.
      Murphy drive into the courtyard. Down stairs flew Mrs. Thrale, but, in a
      few minutes, up she flew again, 'crying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Murphy is crazy for your play&mdash;he won't let me rest for it&mdash;do
      pray let me run away with the first act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little as I like to have it seen in this unfinished state, she was too
      urgent to be resisted, so off she made with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not shew my phiz till I was summoned to dinner. Mr. Murphy, probably
      out of flummery, made us wait some minutes, and, when he did come, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had much ado not to keep you all longer, for I could hardly get away
      from some new acquaintances I was just making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he could not stay to sleep here, he had only time, after dinner, to
      finish the first act. He was pleased to commend it very liberally; he has
      pointed out two places where he thinks I might enlarge, but has not
      criticised one word; on the contrary, the dialogue he has honoured with
      high praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Brighthelmstone, May 26</i>. The road from Streatham hither is
      beautiful: Mr., Mrs., Miss Thrale, and Miss Susan Thrale, and I, travelled
      in a coach, with four horses, and two of the servants in a chaise, besides
      two men on horseback; so we were obliged to stop for some time at three
      places on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got home by about nine o'clock. Mr. Thrale's house is in West Street,
      which is the court end of the town here, as well as in London. 'Tis a
      neat, small house, and I have a snug comfortable room to myself. The sea
      is not many yards from our windows. Our journey was delightfully pleasant,
      the day being heavenly, the roads in fine order, the prospects charming,
      and everybody good-humoured and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday.</i> Just before we went to dinner, a chaise drove up to the
      door, and from it issued Mr. Murphy. He met with, a very joyful reception;
      and Mr. Thrale, for the first time in his life, said he was &ldquo;a good
      fellow&rdquo;: for he makes it a sort of rule to salute him with the title of
      &ldquo;scoundrel,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rascal.&rdquo; They are very old friends; and I question if Mr.
      Thrale loves any man so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made me many very flattering speeches, of his eagerness to go on with
      my play, to know what became of the several characters, and to what place
      I should next conduct them; assuring me that the first act had run in his
      head ever since he had read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening we all, adjourned to Major H&mdash;'s, where, besides his
      own family, we found Lord Mordaunt, son to the Earl of Peterborough,&mdash;a
      pretty, languid, tonnish young man; Mr. Fisher, who is said to be a
      scholar, but is nothing enchanting as a gentleman; young Fitzgerald, as
      much the thing as ever; and Mr. Lucius Corcannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murphy was the life of the party: he was in good spirits, and
      extremely entertaining; he told a million of stories, admirably well; but
      stories won't do upon paper, therefore I shall not attempt to present you
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Mr. Murphy said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must now go to the seat by the seaside, with my new set of
      acquaintance, from whom I expect no little entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;and there you'll find us all! I believe this
      rogue means me for Lady Smatter; but Mrs. Voluble<a href="#linknote-96"
       name="linknoteref-96" id="linknoteref-96">[96]</a> must speak the
      epilogue, Mr. Murphy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must depend upon who performs the part,&rdquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk of it now,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;for Mr. Thrale knows nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; cried Mr. Murphy, &ldquo;you might touch upon his character in
      'Censor.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried Mr. Thrale, &ldquo;I expect a knock some time or other; but, when it
      comes, I'll carry all my myrmidons to cat-call!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murphy then made me fetch him the second act, and walked off with it.

    <h2>
      A SCENE ON THE BRIGHTON PARADE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We afterwards went on the parade, where the soldiers were mustering, and
      found Captain Fuller's men all half intoxicated, and laughing so violently
      as we passed by them, that they could hardly stand upright. The captain
      stormed at them most angrily; but, turning to us, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These poor fellows have just been paid their arrears, and it is so
      unusual to them to have a sixpence in their pockets, that they know not
      how to keep it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind being extremely high, our caps and gowns were blown about most
      abominably; and this increased the risibility of the merry light infantry.
      Captain 'Fuller's desire to keep order made me laugh as much as the men's
      incapacity to obey him; for, finding our flying drapery provoked their
      mirth, he went up to the biggest grinner, and, shaking him violently by
      the shoulders, said, &ldquo;What do you laugh for, sirrah? do you laugh at the
      ladies?&rdquo; and, as soon as he had given the reprimand, it struck him to be
      so ridiculous, that he was obliged to turn quick round, and commit the
      very fault he was attacking most furiously.

    <h2>
      MR. MURPHY CONSIDERS THE DIALOGUE IS CHARMING: A CENSORIOUS LADY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After tea, the bishop, his lady, Lord Mordaunt, and Mrs. H&mdash; seated
      themselves to play at whist, and Mr. Murphy, coming up to me, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had no opportunity, Miss Burney, to tell you how much I have been
      entertained this morning, but I have a great deal to say to you about it;
      I am extremely pleased with it, indeed. The dialogue is charming; and the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;Mr. Murphy always flirting with Miss
      Burney? And here, too, where everybody's watched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she cast her eyes towards Mrs. H&mdash;, who is as censorious a
      country lady as ever locked up all her ideas in a country town. She has
      told us sneering anecdotes of every woman and every officer in Brighthelm
      stone. Mr. Murphy, checked by Mrs. Thrale's exclamation, stopt the
      conversation, and said he must run away, but would return in half-an-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't expect, however, Miss Burney,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall bring with me what
      you are thinking of; no, I can't part with it yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What! at it again cried Mrs. Thrale. &ldquo;This flirting is incessant; but it's
      all to Mr. Murphy's credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale told me afterwards, that she made these speeches to divert the
      attention of the company from our subject; for that she found they were
      all upon the watch the moment Mr. Murphy addressed me, and that the bishop
      and his lady almost threw down their cards, from eagerness to discover
      what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper was very gay: Mrs. Thrale was in high spirits, and her wit
      flashed with incessant brilliancy; Mr. Murphy told several stories with
      admirable humour; and the Bishop of Peterborough was a worthy third in
      contributing towards general entertainment. He turns out most gaily
      sociable. Mrs. H&mdash;was discussed, and, poor lady, not very mercifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale says she lived upon the Steyn, for the pleasure of viewing,
      all day long, who walked with who, how often the same persons were seen
      together, and what visits were made by gentlemen to ladies, or ladies to
      gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She often tells me,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;of my men. 'Oh,' she says,
      'Captain Fuller, your men are always after the ladies!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;I should have thought the officers might have
      contented her; but if she takes in the soldiers too, she must have
      business enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she gets no satisfaction by her complaints; for I only say, 'Why,
      ma'am, we are all young!&mdash;all young and gay!&mdash;and how can we do
      better than follow the ladies?'&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A MILITIA CAPTAIN OFFICIATES AS BARBER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday, May 29</i>. After breakfast, Mrs. and Miss Thrale took me to
      Widget's, the milliner and library-woman on the Steyn. After a little
      dawdling conversation, Captain Fuller came in to have a little chat. He
      said he had just gone through a great operation&mdash;&ldquo;I have been,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;cutting off the hair of all my men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the Duke of Richmond ordered that it should be done, and the fellows
      swore that they would not submit to it; so I was forced to be the operator
      myself. I told them they would look as smart again when they had got on
      their caps; but it went much against them, they vowed, at first, they
      would not bear such usage; some said they would sooner be run through the
      body, and others, that the duke should as soon have their heads. I told
      them I would soon try that, and fell to work myself with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did they bear it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor fellows, with great good-nature, when they found his honour was
      their barber: but I thought proper to submit to bearing all their oaths,
      and all their jokes; for they had no other comfort but to hope I should
      have enough of it, and such sort of wit. Three or four of them, however,
      escaped, but I shall find them out. I told them I had a good mind to cut
      my own hair off too, and then they would have a Captain Crop. I shall
      soothe them to-morrow with a present of new feathers for all their caps.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      &ldquo;HEARTS HAVE AT YE ALL.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Streatham, Sunday, June 13</i>. After church we all strolled the
      grounds, and the topic of our discourse was Miss Streatfield. Mrs. Thrale
      asserted that she had a power of captivation that was irresistible; that
      her beauty, joined to her softness, her caressing manners, her tearful
      eyes, and alluring looks, would insinuate her into the heart of any man
      she thought worth attacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Philip<a href="#linknote-97" name="linknoteref-97" id="linknoteref-97">[97]</a>
      declared himself of a totally different opinion, and quoted Dr. Johnson
      against her, who had told him that, taking away her Greek, she was as
      ignorant as a butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Seward declared her Greek was all against her, with him, for that,
      instead of reading Pope, Swift, or &ldquo;The Spectator&rdquo;&mdash;books from which
      she might derive useful knowledge and improvement&mdash;it had led her to
      devote all her reading time to the first eight books of Homer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;her Greek, you must own, has made all her
      celebrity:&mdash;you would have heard no more of her than of any other
      pretty girl, but for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I object to,&rdquo; said Sir Philip, &ldquo;is her avowed preference for this
      parson. Surely it is very indelicate in any lady to let all the world know
      with whom she is in love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parson,&rdquo; said the severe Mr. Seward, &ldquo;I suppose, spoke first,&mdash;or
      she would as soon have been in love with you, or with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You will easily believe I gave him no pleasant look. He wanted me to
      slacken my pace, and tell him, in confidence, my private opinion of her:
      but I told him, very truly, that as I knew her chiefly by account, not by
      acquaintance, I had not absolutely formed my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I to live with her four days,&rdquo; said this odd man, &ldquo;I believe the
      fifth I should want to take her to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd be devilish tired of her, though,&rdquo; said Sir Philip, &ldquo;in half a
      year. A crying wife will never do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the pleasure of soothing her would make amends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;I would insure her power of crying herself into
      any of your hearts she pleased. I made her cry to Miss Burney, to show how
      beautiful she looked in tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had been her,&rdquo; said Mr. Seward, &ldquo;I would never have visited you
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but she liked it,&rdquo; answered Mrs. T., &ldquo;for she knows how well she does
      it. Miss Burney would have run away, but she came forward on purpose to
      show herself. I would have done so by nobody else&mdash;but Sophy
      Streatfield is never happier than when the tears trickle from her fine
      eyes in company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Mr. Seward, &ldquo;we make her the heroine of our
      comedy? and call it 'Hearts have at ye all?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;it can't be better.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      GIDDY MISS BROWN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At dinner we had three persons added to our company,&mdash;my dear father,
      Miss Streatfield, and Miss Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown, as I foresaw, proved the queen of the day. Miss Streatfield
      requires longer time to make conquests. She is, indeed, much more really
      beautiful than Fanny Brown; but Fanny Brown is much more showy, and her
      open, good-humoured, gay, laughing face inspires an almost immediate wish
      of conversing and merry-making with her. Indeed, the two days she spent
      here have raised her greatly in my regard. She is a charming girl, and so
      natural, and easy, and sweet-tempered, that there is no being half an hour
      in her company without ardently wishing her well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day at breakfast, our party was Sir Philip, Mr. Fuller, Miss
      Streatfield, Miss Brown, the Thrales, and I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first office performed was dressing Miss Brown. She had put on bright,
      jonquil ribbons. Mrs. Thrale exclaimed against them immediately; Mr.
      Fuller half joined her, and away she went, and brought green ribbons of
      her own, which she made Miss Brown run up stairs with to put on. This she
      did with the utmost good humour; but dress is the last thing in which she
      excels; for she has lived so much abroad, and so much with foreigners at
      home, that she never appears habited as an Englishwoman, nor as a
      high-bred foreigner, but rather as an Italian Opera-dancer; and her wild,
      careless, giddy manner, her loud hearty laugh, and general negligence of
      appearance, contribute to give her that air and look. I like her so much,
      that I am quite sorry she is not better advised, either by her own or some
      friend's judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown, however, was queen of the breakfast: for though her giddiness
      made everybody take liberties with her, her good-humour made everybody
      love her, and her gaiety made everybody desirous to associate with her.
      Sir Philip played with her as with a young and sportive kitten; Mr. Fuller
      laughed and chatted with her; and Mr. Seward, when here, teases and
      torments her. The truth is, he cannot bear her, and she, in return,
      equally fears and dislikes him, but still she cannot help attracting his
      notice.

      SOPHY STREATFIELD AGAIN WEEPS TO ORDER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday, June 16.</i>&mdash;We had at breakfast a scene, of its sort,
      the most curious I ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons were Sir Philip, Mr. Seward, Dr. Delap,<a href="#linknote-98"

      Streatfield, Mrs. Thrale said,

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay I made her cry once for Miss Burney as pretty as could be, but nobody
      does cry so pretty as the S. S. I'm sure, when she cried for Seward, I
      never saw her look half so lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Seward?&rdquo; cried Sir Philip; &ldquo;did she cry for Seward? What a happy dog!
      I hope she'll never cry for me, for if she does, I won't answer for the
      consequences!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seward,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;had affronted Johnson, and then Johnson
      affronted Seward, and then the S. S. cried."<a href="#linknote-99"
       name="linknoteref-99" id="linknoteref-99">[99]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh</i>,&rdquo; cried Sir Philip, &ldquo;that I had but been here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;you'd only have seen how like three fools
      three sensible persons behaved: for my part, I was quite sick of it, and
      of them too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir P.-But what did Seward do? was he not melted?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Not he; he was thinking only of his own affront, and taking fire
      at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-Why, yes, I did take fire, for I went and planted my back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      S.S.-And Mrs. Thrale kept stuffing me with toast-and-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir P.-But what did Seward do with himself? Was not he in extacy? What did
      he do or say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. S.-Oh, I said pho, pho, don't let's have any more of this,&mdash;it's
      making it of too much consequence: no more piping, pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir P.-Well, I have heard so much of these tears, that I would give the
      universe to have a sight of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Well, she shall cry again if you like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      S.S.-No, pray, Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir P.&mdash;Oh, pray, do! pray let me see a little of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. T.-Yes, do cry a little, Sopby [in a wheedling voice], pray do!
      Consider, now, you are going to-day, and it's very hard if you won't cry a
      little: indeed, S. S., you ought to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the wonder of wonders. When Mrs. Thrale, in a coaxing voice,
      suited to a nurse soothing a baby, had run on for some time,&mdash;while
      all the rest of us, in laughter, joined in the request,&mdash;two crystal
      tears came into the soft eyes of the S. S., and rolled gently down her
      cheeks! Such a sight I never saw before, nor could I have believed. She
      offered not to conceal or dissipate them: on the contrary, she really
      contrived to have them seen by everybody. She looked, indeed, uncommonly
      handsome; for her pretty face was not, like Chloe's, blubbered; it was
      smooth and elegant, and neither her features nor complexion were at all
      ruffled; nay, indeed, she was smiling all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, look!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale; &ldquo;see if the tears are not come already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud and rude bursts of laughter broke from us all at once. How, indeed,
      could they be restrained? Yet we all stared, and looked and re-looked
      again and again, twenty times, ere we could believe our eyes. Sir Philip,
      I thought, would have died in convulsions; for his laughter and his
      politeness, struggling furiously with one another, made him almost black
      in the face. Mr. Seward looked half vexed that her crying for him was now
      so much lowered in its flattery, yet grinned incessantly; Miss Thrale
      laughed as much as contempt would allow her: but Dr. Delap seemed
      petrified with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our mirth abated, Sir Philip, colouring violently with his efforts to
      speak, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, ma'am, I'm much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I really believe he spoke without knowing what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful command,&rdquo; said Dr. Delap, very gravely, &ldquo;that lady must
      have over herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She now took out a handkerchief, and wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Philip,&rdquo; cried Mr. Seward, &ldquo;how can you suffer her to dry her own
      eyes?&mdash;you, who sit next her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not dry them for her,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;because I am not the right
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I sat next her,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;she would not dry them herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; cried Dr. Delap, &ldquo;I had a bottle to put them in; 'tis a thousand
      pities they should be wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;she looks for all the world as if nothing
      had happened; for, you know, nothing has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you cry, Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Sir Philip, &ldquo;if we asked you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can cry, I doubt not,&rdquo; said Mr. Seward, &ldquo;on any Proper occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not say this loud enough for the S. S. to hear me, but if I had, she
      would not have taken it for the reflection it meant. She seemed, the whole
      time, totally insensible to the numerous strange and, indeed, impertinent
      speeches which were made and to be very well satisfied that she was only
      manifesting a tenderness of disposition, that increased her beauty of
      countenance. At least, I can put no other construction upon her conduct
      which was, without exception, the strangest I ever saw. Without any
      pretence of affliction,&mdash;to weep merely because she was bid, though
      bid in a manner to forbid any one else,&mdash;to be in good spirits all
      the time,&mdash;to see the whole company expiring of laughter at her
      tears, without being at all offended, and, at last, to dry them up, and go
      on with the same sort of conversation she held before they started!

    <h2>
      &ldquo;EVERYTHING A BORE.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, June 20</i>.&mdash;While I was sitting with Mr. Thrale, in the
      library, Mr. Seward entered. As soon as the first inquiries were over, he
      spoke about what he calls our comedy, and he pressed and teazed me to set
      about it. But he grew, in the evening, so queer, so ennuye, that, in a fit
      of absurdity, I called him &ldquo;Mr. Dry;&rdquo; and the name took so with Mrs.
      Thrale, that I know not when he will lose it. Indeed, there is something
      in this young man's alternate drollery and lassitude, entertaining
      qualities and wearying complaints, that provoke me to more pertness than I
      practise to almost anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play, he said, should have the double title of &ldquo;The Indifferent Man,
      or Everything a Bore;&rdquo; and I protested Mr. Dry should be the hero. And
      then we ran on, jointly planning a succession of ridiculous scenes;&mdash;he
      lashing himself pretty freely though not half so freely, or so much to the
      purpose, as I lashed him; for I attacked him, through the channel of Mr.
      Dry, upon his ennui, his causeless melancholy, his complaining languors,
      his yawning inattention, and his restless discontent. You may easily
      imagine I was in pretty high spirits to go so far: in truth, nothing else
      could either have prompted or excused my facetiousness: and his own
      manners are so cavalier, that they always, with me, stimulate a
      sympathising return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeatedly begged me to go to work, and commit the projected scenes to
      paper: but I thought that might be carrying the jest too far; for as I was
      in no humour to spare him, written raillery might, perhaps, have been less
      to his taste than verbal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He challenged me to meet him the next morning, before breakfast, in the
      library, that we might work together at some scenes, but I thought it as
      well to let the matter drop, and did not make my entry till they were all
      assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, however, ran upon nothing else; and, as soon as we happened to be left
      together, he again attacked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you nothing ready yet? I dare say you have half an
      act in your pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;I have quite forgot the whole business; I was only in the
      humour for it last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall it begin?&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;with Mr. Dry in his study?&mdash;his
      slippers just on, his hair about his ears,&mdash;exclaiming, 'O what a
      bore is life!&mdash;What is to be done next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next?&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;what, before he has done anything at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has dressed himself, you know.&mdash;Well, then he takes up a book&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example, this,&rdquo; cried I, giving him Clarendon's History.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it up in character, and flinging it away, cried
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;this will never do,&mdash;a history by a party writer is
      vidious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then gave him Robertson's &ldquo;America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;is of all reading the most melancholy;&mdash;an account
      of possessions we have lost by our own folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then gave him Baretti's &ldquo;Spanish Travels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; cried he, flinging it aside, &ldquo;can read travels by a fellow who
      never speaks a word of truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I gave him a volume of &ldquo;Clarissa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;a novel writ by a bookseller!&mdash;there is but one
      novel now one can bear to read,&mdash;and that's written by a young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to stop him with Dalrymple's Memoirs, and then proceeded to
      give him various others, upon all which he made severe, splenetic, yet
      comical comments;&mdash;and we continued thus employed till he was
      summoned to accompany Mr. Thrale to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Wednesday, I had some very serious talk with Mr. Seward,&mdash;and
      such as gave me no inclination for railery, though it was concerning his
      ennui on the contrary, I resolved, at that moment, never to rally him upon
      that subject again, for his account of himself filled me with compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me that he had never been well for three hours in a day in his
      life, and that when he was thought only tired he was really so ill that he
      believed scarce another man would stay in company. I was quite shocked at
      this account, and told him, honestly, that I had done him so little
      justice as to attribute all his languors to affectation.

    <h2>
      PROPOSED MATCH BETWEEN MR. SEWARD AND THE WEEPER-AT-WILL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Thrale joined us, Mr. Seward told us he had just seen Dr. Jebb.&mdash;Sir
      Richard, I mean,&mdash;and that he had advised him to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;that will do nothing for you; but if you should
      marry, I have a wife for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the S. S.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The S. S.?&mdash;no!&mdash;she's the last person for you,&mdash;her
      extreme softness, and tenderness, and weeping, would add languor to
      languor, and irritate all your disorders; 'twould be drink to a dropsical
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;it would soothe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit! it would only fatigue you. The wife for you is Lady Anne
      Lindsay. She has birth, wit, and beauty, she has no fortune, and she'd
      readily accept you; and she is such a spirit that she'd animate you, I
      warrant you! O, she would trim you well! you'd be all alive presently.
      She'd take all the care of the money affairs,&mdash;and allow you out of
      them eighteen pence a week! That's the wife for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Seward was by no means &ldquo;agreeable&rdquo; to the proposal; he turned the
      conversation upon the S. S., and gave us an account of two visits he had
      made her, and spoke in favour of her manner of living, temper, and
      character. When he had run on in this strain for some time, Mrs. Thrale
      cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so you are grown very fond of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; answered he, drily, &ldquo;not at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I began to think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;you intended to supplant the
      parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't: I don't know what sort of an old woman she'd make; the tears
      won't do then. Besides, I don't think her so sensible as I used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she's very pleasing,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;and very amiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she's pleasing,&mdash;that's certain; but I don't think she reads
      much; the Greek has spoilt her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but you can read for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true; but does she work well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she does, and that's a better thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay; so it is,&rdquo; said he, saucily, &ldquo;for ladies; ladies should rather write
      than read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But authors,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;before they write should read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning again to the S. S., and being again rallied about her by Mrs.
      Thrale, who said she believed at last he would end there,&mdash;he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if I must marry&mdash;if I was bid to choose between that and
      racking on the wheel, I believe I should go to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We all laughed at this exquisite compliment; but, as he said, it was a
      compliment, for though it proved no passion for her, it proved a
      preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; exclaimed I, &ldquo;you settle it all your own way!&mdash;the
      lady would be ready at any rate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! any man might marry Sophy Streatfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I quite stopt to exclaim against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if he'd pay his court to her.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE FATE OF &ldquo;THE WITLINGS.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <h3>
      FANNY BURNEY to MR. CRISP.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, July 30</i>.&mdash;This seems a strange, unseasonable period
      for my undertaking, but yet, my dear daddy, when you have read my
      conversation with Mr. Sheridan, I believe you will agree that I must have
      been wholly insensible, nay, almost ungrateful, to resist encouragement
      such as he gave me&mdash;nay, more than encouragement, entreaties, all of
      which he warmly repeated to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as to the play itself, I own I had wished to have been the bearer of
      it when I visit Chesington; but you seem so urgent, and my father himself
      is so desirous to carry it you, that I have given that plan up.
    </p>
    <p>
      O my dear daddy, if your next letter were to contain your real opinion of
      it, how should I dread to open it! Be, however, as honest as your good
      nature and delicacy will allow you to be, and assure yourself I shall be
      very certain that all your criticisms will proceed from your earnest
      wishes to obviate those of others, and that you would have much more
      pleasure in being my panegyrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mrs. Gast, I should be glad to know what I would refuse to a sister
      of yours. Make her, therefore, of your coterie, if she is with you while
      the piece is in your possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let me tell you what I wish in regard to this affair. I should
      like that your first reading should have nothing to do with me&mdash;that
      you should go quick through it, or let my father read it to you&mdash;forgetting
      all the time, as much as you can, that Fannikin is the writer, or even
      that it is a play in manuscript, and capable of alterations;&mdash;and
      then, when you have done, I should like to have three lines, telling me,
      as nearly as you can trust my candour, its general effect. After that take
      it to your own desk, and lash it at your leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      FANNY BURNEY to DR. BURNEY.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatal knell, then, is knolled, and down among the dead men sink the
      poor &ldquo;Witlings&rdquo;&mdash;for ever, and for ever, and for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      I give a sigh, whether I will or not, to their memory! for, however
      worthless, they were mes enfans. You, my dear sir, who enjoyed, I really
      think, even more than myself, the astonishing success of my first attempt,
      would, I believe, even more than myself, be hurt at the failure of my
      second; and I am sure I speak from the bottom of a very honest heart, when
      I most solemnly declare, that upon your account any disgrace would mortify
      and afflict me more than upon my own; for whatever appears with your
      knowledge, will be naturally supposed to have met with your approbation,
      and, perhaps, your assistance; therefore, though all particular censure
      would fall where it ought&mdash;upon me&mdash;yet any general censure of
      the whole, and the plan, would cruelly, but certainly involve you in its
      severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You bid me open my heart to you,&mdash;and so, my dearest sir, I will, for
      it is the greatest happiness of my life that I dare be sincere to you. I
      expected many objections to be raised&mdash;a thousand errors to be
      pointed out&mdash;and a million of alterations to be proposed; but the
      suppression of the piece were words I did not expect; indeed, after the
      warm approbation of Mrs. Thrale, and the repeated commendations and
      flattery of Mr. Murphy, how could I?
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not, therefore, pretend to wish you should think a decision, for
      which I was so little prepared, has given me no disturbance; for I must be
      a far more egregious witling than any of those I tried to draw, to imagine
      you could ever credit that I wrote without some remote hope of success now&mdash;though
      I literally did when I composed &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      But my mortification is not at throwing away the characters, or the
      contrivance;&mdash;it is all at throwing away the time,&mdash;which I with
      difficulty stole, and which I have buried in the mere trouble of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      FANNY BURNEY to MR. CRISP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! there are plays that are to be saved, and plays that are not to be
      saved! so good night, Mr. Dabbler!&mdash;good night, Lady Smatter,&mdash;Mrs.
      Sapient,&mdash;Mrs. Voluble,&mdash;Mrs. Wheedle,&mdash;Censor,&mdash;Cecilia,&mdash;Beaufort,&mdash;and
      you, you great oaf, Bobby!&mdash;good night! good night!

      And good morning, Miss Fanny Burney!&mdash;I hope you have opened your
      eyes for some time, and will not close them in so drowsy a fit again&mdash;at
      least till the full of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I won't tell you, I have been absolutely ravished with delight at the fall
      of the curtain; but I intend to take the affair in the tant mieux manner,
      and to console myself for your censure by this greatest proof I have ever
      received of the sincerity, candour, and, let me add, esteem, of my dear
      daddy. And as I happen to love myself rather more than my play, this
      consolation is not a very trifling one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to all you say of my reputation and so forth, I perceive the kindness
      of your endeavours to put me in humour with myself, and prevent my taking
      huff, which, if I did, I should deserve to receive, upon any future trial,
      hollow praise from you,&mdash;and the rest from the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only bad thing in this affair is, that I cannot take the comfort of my
      poor friend Dabbler, by calling you a crabbed fellow, because you write
      with almost more kindness than ever; neither can I (though I try hard)
      persuade myself that you have not a grain of taste in your whole
      composition. This, however, seriously I do believe, that when my two
      daddies put their heads together to concert for me that hissing, groaning,
      catcalling epistle they sent me, they felt as sorry for poor little Miss
      Bayes as she could possibly do for herself.<a href="#linknote-100"

    <h2>
      THE CRYING BEAUTY AND HER MOTHER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Brighthelmstone, October 12.</i>&mdash;On Tuesday Mr., Mrs., Miss
      Thrale, and &ldquo;yours, ma'am, yours,&rdquo; set out on their expedition. The day
      was very pleasant, and the journey delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined very comfortably at Sevenoaks, and thence made but one stage to
      Tunbridge. It was so dark when we went through the town that I could see
      it very indistinctly. The Wells, however, are about seven miles yet
      further, so that we saw that night nothing; but I assure you, I felt that
      I was entering into a new country pretty roughly, for the roads were so
      sidelum and jumblum, as Miss L&mdash; called those of Teignmouth, that I
      expected an overturn every minute. Safely, however, we reached the Sussex
      Hotel, at Tunbridge Wells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having looked at our rooms, and arranged our affairs, we proceeded to
      Mount Ephraim, where Miss Streatfield resides. We found her with only her
      mother, and spent the evening there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Streatfield is very&mdash;very little, but perfectly well made, thin,
      genteel, and delicate. She has been quite beautiful, and has still so much
      of beauty left, that to call it only the remains of a fine face seems
      hardly doing her justice. She is very lively, and an excellent mimic, and
      is, I think, as much superior to her daughter in natural gifts as her
      daughter is to her in acquired ones: and how infinitely preferable are
      parts without education to education without parts!
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair S. S. is really in higher beauty than I have ever yet seen her;
      and she was so caressing, so soft, so amiable, that I felt myself
      insensibly inclining to her with an affectionate regard. &ldquo;If it was not
      for that little, gush,&rdquo; as Dr. Delap said, I should certainly have taken a
      very great fancy to her; but tears so ready&mdash;oh, they blot out my
      fair opinion of her! Yet whenever I am with her, I like, nay, almost love
      her, for her manners are exceedingly captivating; but when I quit her, I
      do not find that she improves by being thought over&mdash;no, nor talked
      over; for Mrs. Thrale, who is always disposed to half adore her in her
      presence, can never converse about her without exciting her own contempt
      by recapitulating what has passed. This, however, must always be certain,
      whatever may be doubtful, that she is a girl in no respect like any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have not yet done with the mother: I have told you of her vivacity
      and her mimicry, but her character is yet not half told. She has a kind of
      whimsical conceit and odd affectation, that, joined to a very singular
      sort of humour, makes her always seem to be rehearsing some scene in a
      comedy. She takes off, if she mentions them, all her own children, and,
      though she quite adores them, renders them ridiculous with all her power.
      She laughs at herself for her smallness and for her vagaries, just with
      the same ease and ridicule as if she were speaking of some other person;
      and, while perpetually hinting at being old and broken, she is continually
      frisking, flaunting, and playing tricks, like a young coquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was introduced to her by Mrs. Thrale, who said, &ldquo;Give me leave,
      ma'am, to present to you a friend of your daughter's&mdash;Miss Burney,&rdquo;
       she advanced to me with a tripping pace, and, taking one of my fingers,
      said, &ldquo;Allow me, ma'am, will you, to create a little&mdash;acquaintance
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, I readily entered into an alliance with her, for I found
      nothing at Tunbridge half so entertaining, except, indeed, Miss Birch, of
      whom hereafter.

    <h2>
      A BEWITCHING PRODIGY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tunbridge Wells is a place that to me appeared very singular; the country
      is all rock, and every part of it is either up or down hill, scarce ten
      yards square being level ground in the whole place: the houses, too, are
      scattered about in a strange wild manner, and look as if they had been
      dropt where they stand by accident, for they form neither streets nor
      squares, but seem strewed promiscuously, except, indeed, where the
      shopkeepers live, who have got two or three dirty little lanes, much like
      dirty little lanes in other places.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening we all went to the rooms. The rooms, as they are called,
      consisted for this evening, of only one apartment, as there was not
      company enough to make more necessary, and a very plain, unadorned, and
      ordinary apartment that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning we had the company of two young ladies at breakfast&mdash;the
      S. S. and a Miss Birch, a little girl but ten years old, whom the S. S.
      invited, well foreseeing how much we should all be obliged to her. This
      Miss Birch is a niece of the charming Mrs. Pleydell,<a href="#linknote-105"
       name="linknoteref-105" id="linknoteref-105">[105]</a> and so like her,
      that I should have taken her for her daughter, yet she is not, now, quite
      so handsome; but as she will soon know how to display her beauty to the
      utmost advantage, I fancy, in a few years, she will yet more resemble her
      lovely and most bewitching aunt. Everybody, she said, tells her how like
      she is to her aunt Pleydell.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you, therefore, have seen that sweet woman, only imagine her ten years
      old, and you will see her sweet niece. Nor does the resemblance rest with
      the person; she sings like her, laughs like her, talks like her, caresses
      like her, and alternately softens and animates just like her. Her
      conversation is not merely like that of a woman already, but like that of
      a most uncommonly informed, cultivated, and sagacious woman; and at the
      same time that her understanding is thus wonderfully premature, she can,
      at pleasure, throw off all this rationality, and make herself a mere
      playful, giddy, romping child. One moment, with mingled gravity and
      sarcasm, she discusses characters, and the next, with schoolgirl spirits,
      she jumps round the room; then, suddenly, she asks, &ldquo;Do you know such or
      such a song?&rdquo; and instantly, with mixed grace and buffoonery, singles out
      an object, and sings it; and then, before there has been time to applaud
      her, she runs into the middle of the room, to try some new step in a
      dance; and after all this, without waiting till her vagaries grow
      tiresome, she flings herself, with an affectionate air upon somebody's
      lap, and there, composed and thoughtful, she continues quiet till she
      again enters into rational conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice is really charming&mdash;infinitely the most powerful, as well
      as sweet, I ever heard at her age. Were she well and constantly taught,
      she might, I should think, do anything,&mdash;for two or three Italian
      songs, which she learnt out of only five months' teaching by Parsons, she
      sung like a little angel, with respect to taste, feeling, and expression;
      but she now learns of nobody, and is so fond of French songs, for the
      sake, she says, of the sentiment, that I fear she will have her wonderful
      abilities all thrown away. Oh, how I wish my father had the charge of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      She has spent four years out of her little life in France, which has made
      her distractedly fond of the French operas, &ldquo;Rose et Colas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Annette et
      Lubin,&rdquo; etc., and she told us the story quite through of several I never
      heard of, always singing the sujet when she came to the airs, and
      comically changing parts in the duets. She speaks French with the same
      fluency as English, and every now and then, addressing herself to the S.
      S.&mdash;&ldquo;Que je vous adore!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, permettez que je me mette a vos
      pieds!&rdquo; etc., with a dying languor that was equally laughable and lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I found, by her taught songs, what a delightful singer she was
      capable of becoming, I really had not patience to hear her little French
      airs, and entreated her to give them up, but the little rogue instantly
      began pestering me with them, singing one after another with a comical
      sort of malice, and following me round the room, when I said I would not
      listen to her, to say, &ldquo;But is not this pretty?&mdash;and this?&mdash;and
      this?&rdquo; singing away with all her might and main.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sung without any accompaniment, as we had no instrument; but the S. S.
      says she plays too, very well. Indeed, I fancy she can do well whatever
      she pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hardly knew how to get away from her when the carriage was ready to
      take us from Tunbridge, and Mrs. Thrale was so much enchanted with her
      that she went on the Pantiles and bought her a very beautiful inkstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean, Miss Birch,&rdquo; she said, when she gave it her, &ldquo;to present
      you this toy as to a child, but merely to beg you will do me the favour to
      accept something that may make you now and then remember us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was much delighted with this present, and told me, in a whisper, that
      she should put a drawing of it in her journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you see, Susy, other children have had this whim. But something being
      said of novels, the S. S. said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selina, do you ever read them?&rdquo;&mdash;And, with a sigh, the little girl
      answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But too often!&mdash;-I wish I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only thing I did not like in this seducing little creature was our
      leave-taking. The S. S. had, as we expected, her fine eyes suffused with
      tears, and nothing would serve the little Selina, who admires the S. S.
      passionately, but that she, also, must weep&mdash;and weep, therefore, she
      did, and that in a manner as pretty to look at, as soft, as melting, and
      as little to her discomposure, as the weeping of her fair exemplar. The
      child's success in this pathetic art made the tears of both appear to the
      whole party to be lodged, as the English merchant says, &ldquo;very near the
      eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doubtful as it is whether we shall ever see this sweet syren again,
      nothing, as Mrs. Thrale said to her, can be more certain than that we
      shall hear of her again, let her go whither she will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charmed as we all were with her, we all agreed that to have the care of
      her would be distraction! &ldquo;She seems the girl in the world,&rdquo; Mrs. Thrale
      wisely said, &ldquo;to attain the highest reach of human perfection as a man's
      mistress!&mdash;as such she would be a second Cleopatra, and have the
      world at her command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor thing! I hope to heaven she will escape such sovereignty and such
      honours!

    <h2>
      AT BRIGHTON: A &ldquo;CURE.&rdquo; THE JEALOUS CUMBERLANDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We left Tunbridge Wells, and got, by dinner time, to our first stage,
      Uckfield. Our next stage brought us to Brighthelmstone, where I fancy we
      shall stay till the Parliament calls away Mr. Thrale.<a
      href="#linknote-106" name="linknoteref-106" id="linknoteref-106">[106]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after our arrival, our first visit was from Mr Kipping, the
      apothecary, a character so curious that Foote<a href="#linknote-107"
       name="linknoteref-107" id="linknoteref-107">[107]</a> designed him for his
      next piece, before he knew he had already written his last. He is a
      prating, good-humoured old gossip, who runs on in as incoherent and
      unconnected a style of discourse as Rose Fuller, though not so tonish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the morning we spent, as usual at this place, upon the Steyn,
      and in booksellers' shops. Mrs. Thrale entered all our names at Thomas's,
      the fashionable bookseller; but we find he has now a rival, situated also
      upon the Steyn, who seems to carry away all the custom and all the
      company. This is a Mr. Bowen, who is just come from London, and who seems
      just the man to carry the world before him as a shop-keeper. Extremely
      civil, attentive to watch opportunities Of obliging, and assiduous to make
      use of them&mdash;skilful in discovering the taste or turn of mind of his
      customers, and adroit in putting in their way just such temptations as
      they are least able to withstand. Mrs. Thrale, at the same time that she
      sees his management and contrivance, so much admires his sagacity and
      dexterity, that, though open-eyed, she is as easily wrought upon to part
      with her money, as any of the many dupes in this place, whom he persuades
      to require indispensably whatever he shows them. He did not, however, then
      at all suspect who I was, for he showed me nothing but schemes for
      raffles, and books, pocket-cases, etc., which weie put up for those
      purposes. It is plain I can have no authoress air, since so discerning a
      bookseller thought me a fine lady spendthrift, who only wanted occasions
      to get rid of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday morning, as we came out of church, we saw Mrs. Cumberland, one of
      her sons, and both her daughters. Mrs. Thrale spoke to them, but I believe
      they did not recollect me. They are reckoned the flashers of the place,
      yet everybody laughs at them for their airs, affectations, and tonish
      graces and impertinences.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, Mrs. Dickens, a lady of Mrs. Thrale's acquaintance,
      invited us to drink tea at the rooms with her, which we did, and found
      them much more full and lively than the preceding night. The folks of most
      consequence with respect to rank, were Lady Pembroke and Lady Di
      Beauclerk,<a href="#linknote-108" name="linknoteref-108"
       id="linknoteref-108">[108]</a> both of whom have still very pleasing
      remains of the beauty for which they have been so much admired. But the
      present beauty, whose remains our children (i.e. nieces) may talk of, is a
      Mrs. Musters, an exceedingly pretty woman, who is the reigning toast of
      the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mrs. Thrale, Mrs. Dickens, and I were walking about after tea, we
      were joined by a Mr. Cure, a gentleman of the former's acquaintance. After
      a little while he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Thrale is very much grown since she was here last year; and besides,
      I think she's vastly altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, sir,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I can't say I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh vastly!&mdash;but young ladies at that age are always altering. To
      tell you the truth, I did not know her at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, for a little while, passed quietly; but soon after, he exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am, do you know I have not yet read 'Evelina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have not you so, sir?&rdquo; cried she, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and I think I never shall, for there's no getting it. The booksellers
      say they never can keep it a moment, and the folks that hire it keep
      lending it from one to another in such a manner that it is never returned
      to the library. It's very provoking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;what makes you exclaim about it so to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because, if you recollect, the last thing you said to me when we
      parted last year, was&mdash;be sure you read 'Evelina.' So as soon as I
      saw you I recollected it all again. But I wish Miss Thrale would turn more
      this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you mean, Mr. Cure? do you know Miss Thrale now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure,&rdquo; answered he, looking full at me, &ldquo;though I protest I
      should not have guessed at her had I seen her with anybody but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ho!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, laughing, &ldquo;so you mean Miss Burney all this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cure looked aghast. As soon, I suppose, as he was able, he repeated,
      in a low voice, &ldquo;Miss Burney! so then that lady is the authoress of
      'Evelina' all this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, rather abruptly, he left us and joined another party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose he told his story to as many as he talked to, for, in a short
      time, I found myself so violently stared at that I could hardly look any
      way without being put quite out of countenance,&mdash;particularly by
      young Mr. Cumberland, a handsome, soft-looking youth, who fixed his eyes
      upon me incessantly, though but the evening before, when I saw him at
      Hicks's, he looked as if it would have been a diminution of his dignity to
      have regarded me twice. One thing proved quite disagreeable to me, and
      that was the whole behaviour of the whole tribe of the Cumberlands, which
      I must explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cumberland,<a href="#linknote-109" name="linknoteref-109"
       id="linknoteref-109">[109]</a> when he saw Mrs. Thrale, flew with
      eagerness to her and made her take his seat, and he talked to her, with
      great friendliness and intimacy, as he has been always accustomed to do,&mdash;and
      inquired very particularly concerning her daughter, expressing an earnest
      desire to see her. But when, some time after, Mrs. Thrale said, &ldquo;Oh, there
      is my daughter, with Miss Burney,&rdquo; he changed the discourse abruptly,&mdash;never
      came near Miss Thrale, and neither then nor since, when he has met Mrs.
      Thrale, has again mentioned her name: and the whole evening he seemed
      determined to avoid us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cumberland contented herself with only looking at me as at a person
      she had no reason or business to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two daughters, but especially the eldest, as well as the son, were by
      no means so quiet; they stared at me every time I came near them as if I
      had been a thing for a show; surveyed me from head to foot, and then
      again, and again returned to my face, with so determined and so unabating
      a curiosity, that it really made me uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the folks here impute the whole of this conduct to its having
      transpired that I am to bring out a play this season; for Mr. Cumberland,
      though in all other respects an agreeable and a good man, is so notorious
      for hating and envying and spiting all authors in the dramatic line, that
      he is hardly decent in his behaviour towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has little reason, at present at least, to bear me any ill-will; but if
      he is capable of such weakness and malignity as to have taken an aversion
      to me merely because I can make use of pen and ink, he deserves not to
      hear of my having suppressed my play, or of anything else that can gratify
      so illiberal a disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson, Mr. Cholmondeley, and Mr. and Mrs. Thrale have all repeatedly
      said to me, &ldquo;Cumberland no doubt hates you heartily by this time;&rdquo; but it
      always appeared to me a speech of mingled fun and flattery, and I never
      dreamed of its being possible to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days since, after tea at Mrs. Dickens's, we all went to the rooms.
      There was a great deal of company, and among them the Cumberlands. The
      eldest of the girls, who was walking with Mrs. Musters, quite turned round
      her whole person every time we passed each other, to keep me in sight, and
      stare at me as long as possible; so did her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw anything so ill-bred and impertinent; I protest I was ready to
      quit the rooms to avoid them&mdash;till at last Miss Thrale, catching Miss
      Cumberland's eye, gave her so full, determined, and downing a stare, that
      whether cured by shame or by resentment, she forbore from that time to
      look at either of us. Miss Thrale, with a sort of good-natured dryness,
      said, &ldquo;Whenever you are disturbed with any of these starers, apply to me,&mdash;I'll
      warrant I'll cure them. I dare say the girl hates me for it; but what
      shall I be the worse for that? I would have served master Dickey<a
      href="#linknote-110" name="linknoteref-110" id="linknoteref-110">[110]</a>
      so too, only I could not catch his eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Oct. 20</i>&mdash;We have had a visit from Dr. Delap. He told me that
      he had another tragedy, and that I should have it to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very curious to see Mr. Cumberland, who, it seems, has given
      evident marks of displeasure at his name whenever Mrs. Thrale has
      mentioned it. That poor man is so wonderfully narrow-minded in his
      authorship capacity, though otherwise good, humane and generous, that he
      changes countenance at either seeing or hearing of any writer whatsoever.
      Mrs. Thrale, with whom, this foible excepted, he is a great favourite, is
      so enraged with him for his littleness of soul in this respect, that
      merely to plague him, she vowed at the rooms she would walk all the
      evening between Dr. Delap and me. I wished so little to increase his
      unpleasant feelings, that I determined to keep with Miss Thrale and Miss
      Dickens entirely. One time, though, Mrs. Thrale, when she was sitting by
      Dr. Delap, called me suddenly to her, and when I was seated, said, &ldquo;Now
      let's see if Mr. Cumberland will come and speak to me!&rdquo; But he always
      turns resolutely another way when he sees her with either of us; though at
      all other times he is particularly fond of her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would actually serve him right,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;to make Dr. Delap and you
      strut at each side of me, one with a dagger, and the other with a mask, as
      tragedy and comedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Miss Burney,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you and I seem to stand in the
      same predicament. What shall we do for the poor man? suppose we burn a
      play apiece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;he has heard, in town, that you are
      both to bring one out this season, and perhaps one of his own may be
      deferred on that account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the announcement of the carriage, we went into the next room for our
      cloaks, where Mrs. Thrale and Mr. Cumberland were in deep conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here's Miss Burney!&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale aloud. Mr Cumberland turned
      round, but withdrew his eyes instantly; and I, determined not to interrupt
      them, made Miss Thrale walk away with me. In about ten minutes she left
      him and we all came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we were in the carriage,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, warmly, &ldquo;all I could do not to affront
      Mr. Cumberland to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I would not have you for the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have refrained; but with great difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she told me the conversation she had just had with him. As soon
      as I made off, he said, with a spiteful tone of voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that young lady is an author, I hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;author of 'Evelina.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph,&mdash;I am told it has some humour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, indeed! Johnson says nothing like it has appeared for years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; cried he, biting his lips, and waving uneasily in his chair, &ldquo;so,
      so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;and Sir Joshua Reynolds told Mr. Thrale he would
      give fifty pounds to know the author!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, so&mdash;oh, vastly well!&rdquo; cried he, putting his hand on his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;Burke himself sat up all night to finish it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed quite too much for him; he put both his hands to his face, and
      waving backwards and forwards, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, vastly well!&mdash;this will do for anything!&rdquo; with a tone as much as
      to say, Pray, no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Thrale bid him good night, longing, she said, to call Miss
      Thrale first, and say, &ldquo;So you won't speak to my daughter?&mdash;why, she
      is no author.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      AN AMUSING CHARACTER: HIS VIEWS ON MANY SUBJECTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>October 20.</i>&mdash;I must now have the honour to present to you a
      new acquaintance, who this day dined here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y,<a href="#linknote-111" name="linknoteref-111"
       id="linknoteref-111">[111]</a> an Irish gentleman, late a commissary in
      Germany. He is between sixty and seventy, but means to pass for about
      thirty; gallant, complaisant, obsequious, and humble to the fair sex, for
      whom he has an awful reverence; but when not immediately addressing them,
      swaggering, blustering, puffing, and domineering. These are his two
      apparent characters; but the real man is worthy, moral, religious, though
      conceited and parading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is as fond of quotations as my poor Lady Smatter,<a href="#linknote-112"
       name="linknoteref-112" id="linknoteref-112">[112]</a> and, like her, knows
      little beyond a song, and always blunders about the author of that. His
      whole conversation consists in little French phrases, picked up during his
      residence abroad, and in anecdotes and story-telling, which are sure to be
      retold daily and daily in the same words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the ball in the evening, to which we were all going, &ldquo;Ah,
      madam!&rdquo; said he to Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;there was a time when&mdash;fol-de-rol,
      fol-de-rol [rising, and dancing and Singing], fol-de-rol!&mdash;I could
      dance with the best of them; but now a man, forty and upwards, as my Lord
      Ligonier used to say&mdash;but&mdash;fol-de-rol!&mdash;there was a time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, so there was, Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;and I think
      you and I together made a very venerable appearance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madam, I remember once, at Bath, I was called out to dance with one
      of the finest young ladies I ever saw. I was just preparing to do my best,
      when a gentleman of my acquaintance was so cruel as to whisper me&mdash;'B&mdash;&mdash;y!
      the eyes of all Europe are upon you!' for that was the phrase of the
      times. 'B&mdash;&mdash;y!' says he, 'the eyes of all Europe are upon you!'&mdash;I
      vow, ma'am, enough to make a man tremble!-fol-de-rol, fol-de-rol! [dancing]&mdash;the
      eyes of all Europe are upon you!&mdash;I declare, ma'am, enough to put a
      man out of countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am absolutely almost ill with laughing. This Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y half
      convulses me; yet I cannot make you laugh by writing his speeches, because
      it is the manner which accompanies them, that, more than the matter,
      renders them so peculiarly ridiculous. His extreme pomposity, the solemn
      stiffness of his person, the conceited twinkling of his little old eyes,
      and the quaint importance of his delivery, are so much more like some
      pragmatical old coxcomb represented on the stage, than like anything in
      real and common life, that I think, were I a man, I should sometimes be
      betrayed into clapping him for acting so well. As it is, I am sure no
      character in any comedy I ever saw has made me laugh more extravagantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dines and spends the evening here constantly, to my great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, when Mrs. Thrale offers him a seat next her, he regularly says,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are les charmantes?&rdquo; meaning Miss T. and me. &ldquo;I can do nothing
      till they are accommodated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, whenever he drinks a glass of wine, he never fails to touch either
      Mrs. Thrale's, or my glass, with &ldquo;est-il permis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at the same time that he is so courteous, he is proud to a most
      sublime excess, and thinks every person to whom he speaks honoured beyond
      measure by his notice, nay, he does not even look at anybody without
      evidently displaying that such notice is more the effect of his benign
      condescension, than of any pretension on their part to deserve such a mark
      of his perceiving their existence. But you will think me mad about this
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Nov. 3</i>&mdash;Last Monday we went again to the ball. Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y,
      who was there, and seated himself next to Lady Pembroke, at the top of the
      room, looked most sublimely happy! He continues still to afford me the
      highest diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he is notorious for his contempt of all artists, whom he looks upon
      with little more respect than upon day-labourers, the other day, when
      painting was discussed, he spoke of Sir Joshua Reynolds as if he had been
      upon a level with a carpenter or farrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;see his Nativity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&mdash;but I know his pictures very well; I knew him many years
      ago, in Minorca; he drew my picture there; and then he knew how to take a
      moderate price; but now, I vow, ma'am, 'tis scandalous&mdash;scandalous
      indeed! to pay a fellow here seventy guineas for scratching out a head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Dr. Delap, &ldquo;you must not run down Sir Joshua Reynolds,
      because he is Miss Burney's friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I don't want to run the man down; I like him well
      enough in his proper place; he is as decent as any man of that sort I ever
      knew; but for all that, sir, his prices are shameful. Why, he would not
      (looking at the poor doctor with an enraged contempt) he would not do your
      head under seventy guineas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;he had one portrait at the last exhibition,
      that I think hardly could be paid enough for; it was of a Mr. Stuart; I
      had never done admiring it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What stuff is this, ma'am!&rdquo; cried Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y, &ldquo;how can two or
      three dabs of paint ever be worth such a sum as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Selwyn<a href="#linknote-113" name="linknoteref-113"
       id="linknoteref-113">[113]</a> (always willing to draw him out), &ldquo;you know
      not how much he is improved since you knew him in Minorca; he is now the
      finest painter, perhaps, in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho, pho, sir,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;how can you talk so? you, Mr. Selwin, who have
      seen so many capital pictures abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, sir,&rdquo; said the ever odd Dr. Delap, &ldquo;you must not go on so
      undervaluing him, for, I tell you, he is a friend of Miss Burney's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y, &ldquo;I tell you again I have no objection to
      the man; I have dined in his company two or three times; a very decent man
      he is, fit to keep company with gentlemen; but, ma'am, what are all your
      modern dabblers put together to one ancient? nothing!&mdash;a set of&mdash;not
      a Rubens among them! I vow, ma'am, not a Rubens among them!&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      To go on with the subject I left off with last&mdash;my favourite subject
      you will think it&mdash;-Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y. I must inform you that his
      commendation was more astonishing to me than anybody's could be, as I had
      really taken it for granted he had hardly noticed my existence. But he has
      also spoken very well of Dr. Delap&mdash;that is to say, in a very
      condescending manner. &ldquo;That Mr. Delap,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;seems a good sort of
      man; I wish all the cloth were like him; but, lackaday! 'tis no such
      thing; the clergy in general are but odd dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever plays are mentioned, we have also a regular speech about them. &ldquo;I
      never,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;go to a tragedy,&mdash;it's too affecting; tragedy
      enough in real life: tragedies are only fit for fair females; for my part,
      I cannot bear to see Othello tearing about in that violent manner&mdash;and
      fair little Desdemona, ma'am, 'tis too affecting! to see your kings and
      your princes tearing their pretty locks,&mdash;oh, there's no standing it!
      'A straw-crown'd monarch,'&mdash;what is that, Mrs. Thrale?
    </p>
    <p>
      'A straw-crown'd monarch in mock majesty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't recollect now where that is; but for my part, I really cannot
      bear to see such sights. And then out come the white handkerchiefs, and
      all their pretty eyes are wiping, and then come poison and daggers, and
      all that kind of thing,&mdash;O ma'am, 'tis too much; but yet the fair
      tender hearts, the pretty little females, all like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, word for word, I have already heard from him literally four
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Garrick was mentioned, he honoured him with much the same style
      of compliment as he had done Sir Joshua Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that Garrick was another of those fellows that people
      run mad about. Ma'am, 'tis a shaine to think of such things! an actor
      living like a person of quality scandalous! I vow, scandalous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;commend me to Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale &ldquo;for
      he is your only man to put down all the people that everybody else sets
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma'am,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I like all these people very well in their
      proper places; but to see such a set of poor beings living like persons of
      quality,&mdash;'tis preposterous! common sense, madam, common sense is
      against that kind of thing. As to Garrick, he was a very good mimic, an
      entertaining fellow enough, and all that kind of thing&mdash;-but for an
      actor to live like a person of quality&mdash;oh, scandalous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some time after the musical tribe was mentioned. He was at cards at the
      time with Mr. Selwyn, Dr. Delap, and Mr. Thrale, while we &ldquo;fair females,&rdquo;
       as he always calls us, were speaking of Agujari.<a href="#linknote-114"
       name="linknoteref-114" id="linknoteref-114">[114]</a> He constrained
      himself from flying out as long as he was able; but upon our mentioning
      her having fifty pounds a song, he suddenly, in a great rage, called out,
      &ldquo;Catgut and rosin! ma'am, 'tis scandalous!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      The other day, at dinner, the subject was married life, and among various
      husbands and wives Lord L&mdash; being mentioned, Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y
      pronounced his panegyric, and called him his friend. Mr. Selwyn, though
      with much gentleness, differed from him in opinion, and declared he could
      not think well of him, as he knew his lady, who was an amiable woman, was
      used very ill by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; cried Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known him,&rdquo; answered Mr. Selwyn, &ldquo;frequently pinch her till she
      has been ready to cry with pain, though she has endeavoured to prevent its
      being observed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;know that he pulled her nose, in his frantic
      brutality, till he broke-some of the vessels of it, and when she was dying
      she still found the torture he had given her by it so great, that it was
      one of her last complaints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general, who is all for love and gallantry, far from attempting to
      vindicate his friend, quite swelled with indignation on this account, and,
      after a pause, big with anger, exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched doings, sir, wretched doings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I have known him,&rdquo; added Mr. Selwyn, &ldquo;insist upon handing her to her
      carriage, and then, with an affected kindness, pretend to kiss her hand,
      instead of which he has almost bit a piece out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pitiful!&mdash;pitiful! sir,&rdquo; cried the General, &ldquo;I know nothing more
      shabby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was equally inhuman to his daughter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;for, in one
      of his rages, he almost throttled her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched doings!&rdquo; again exclaimed Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y, &ldquo;what! cruel to a
      fair female! Oh fie! fie! fie!&mdash;a fellow who can be cruel to females
      and children, or animals, must be a pitiful fellow indeed. I wish we had
      had him here in the sea. I should like to have had him stripped, and that
      kind of thing, and been well banged by ten of our clippers here with a
      cat-o'-nine-tails. Cruel to a fair female? Oh fie! fie! fie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I know not how this may read, but I assure you its sound was ludicrous
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I have never yet told you his most favourite story, though we
      have regularly heard it three or four times a day&mdash;and this is about
      his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some years ago,&rdquo; he says,&mdash;&ldquo;let's see, how many? in the year '71,&mdash;ay,
      '71, '72&mdash;thereabouts&mdash;I was taken very ill, and, by ill-luck, I
      was persuaded to ask advice of one of these Dr. Gallipots:&mdash;oh, how I
      hate them all! Sir, they are the vilest pick-pockets&mdash;know nothing,
      sir! nothing in the world! poor ignorant mortals! and then they pretend&mdash;In
      short, sir, I hate them all!&mdash;I have suffered so much by them, sir&mdash;lost
      four years of the happiness of my life&mdash;let's see, '71, '72, '73, '74&mdash;ay,
      four years, sir!&mdash;mistook my case, sir!&mdash;and all that kind of
      thing. Why, sir, my feet swelled as big as two horses' heads! I vow I will
      never consult one of these Dr. Gallipot fellows again! lost me, sir, four
      years of the happiness of my life!&mdash;why, I grew quite an object!&mdash;-you
      would hardly have known me!&mdash;lost all the calves of my legs!&mdash;had
      not an ounce of flesh left!&mdash;and as to the rouge&mdash;why, my face
      was the colour of that candle!&mdash;those deuced Gallipot fellows!&mdash;why,
      they robbed me of four years&mdash;let me see, ay, '71, '72&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then it was all given again!
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a large party of gentlemen to dinner. Among them was Mr. Hamilton,
      commonly called Single-speech Hamilton, from having made one remarkable
      speech in the House of Commons against government, and receiving some
      douceur to be silent ever after. This Mr. Hamilton is extremely tall and
      handsome; has an air of haughty and fashionable superiority; is
      intelligent, dry, sarcastic, and clever. I should have received much
      pleasure from his conversational powers, had I not previously been
      prejudiced against him, by hearing that he is infinitely artful, double,
      and crafty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner conversation was too general to be well remembered; neither,
      indeed, shall I attempt more than partial scraps relating to matters of
      what passed when we adjourned to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Tidy, and Mr. Thrale seated themselves to
      whist; the rest looked on: but the General, as he always does, took up the
      newspaper, and, with various comments, made aloud, as he went on reading
      to himself, diverted the whole company. Now he would cry, &ldquo;Strange!
      strange that!&rdquo;&mdash;presently, &ldquo;What stuff! I don't believe a word of
      it!&rdquo;&mdash;a little after, &ldquo;Mr. Bate,<a href="#linknote-115"
       name="linknoteref-115" id="linknoteref-115">[115]</a> I wish your ears
      were cropped!&rdquo;&mdash;then, &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! funnibus! funnibus! indeed!&rdquo;&mdash;and,
      at last, in a great rage, he exclaimed, &ldquo;What a fellow is this, to presume
      to arraign the conduct of persons of quality!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having diverted himself and us in this manner, till he had read every
      column methodically through, he began all over again, and presently called
      out, &ldquo;Ha! ha! here's a pretty thing!&rdquo; and then, in a plaintive voice,
      languished out some wretched verses.

    <h2>
      A SEASON AT BATH: MR. THRALE'S DEATH.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [There is a long hiatus here in the published &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; and
     upon its resumption we find Fanny at Bath with the Thrales,
     in April, 1780; but from her letters to Mr. Crisp we learn
     that she returned, at Christmas, 1779, to her father's house
     in St. Martin's Street, and spent there the intervening
     period, frequently visiting, and being visited by, the
     Thrales.  Bath was at this time the most fashionable summer
     resort in the kingdom. Fanny had been there before, in 1776
     or 1777, but of that visit no account remains to us.  She
     has recorded, however, in &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; her general impression
     of the place.  &ldquo;The charming city of Bath answered all my
     expectations.  The Crescent, the prospect from it, and the
     elegant symmetry of the Circus, delighted me.  The Parades,
     I own, rather disappointed me; one of them is scarce
     preferable to some of the best paved streets in London; and
     the other, though it affords a beautiful prospect, a
     charming view of Prior-park and of the Avon, yet wanted
     something in itself of more striking elegance than a mere
     broad pavement, to satisfy the ideas I had formed of it.

     &ldquo;At the pump-room, I was amazed at the public exhibition of
     the ladies in the bath; it is true, their heads are covered
     with bonnets; but the very idea of being seen, in such a
     situation, by whoever pleases to look, is indelicate.&rdquo;

     We may be sure Fanny never exhibited herself in such a
     situation. Of her drinking the waters, even, there is no
     mention in her Bath journal Of 1780.  But the journal
     records a continual succession of visits and diversions, and
     keeps us entertained with the most life-like and amusing
     descriptions of Bath society.  The house occupied by Mr.
     Thrale and his party was at the corner of the South-parade,
     and Fanny's room commanded that beautiful prospect of Prior-
     park and the Avon which had charmed Evelina.

     Amid all these gaieties there are glimpses of more serious
     scenes.  The Gordon riots took place in June, 1780, and the
     alarm they occasioned spread far and wide over the country.
     The present section, too, closes with a melancholy incident&mdash;
     the death of Mr. Thrale.  He had been long ailing, and had
     had a paralytic stroke in 1779.  He died on the 4th of
     April, 1781.  Probably no one felt the loss more keenly than
     Thrale's old friend, 'Dr. Johnson, in whose &ldquo;Prayers and
     Meditations&rdquo; occurs the following touching entry:&mdash;

     &ldquo;Good Friday, 13th April, 1781.  On Wednesday, 11th, was
     buried my dear friend Thrale, who died on Wednesday, 4th;
     and with him were buried many of my hopes and pleasures.
     About five, I think, on Wednesday morning he expired.  I
     felt almost the last flutter of his pulse, and looked for
     the last time upon the face that for fifteen years had never
     been turned upon me but with respect or benignity.&rdquo;&mdash;ED.]

    <h2>
      A YOUTHFUL PRODIGY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Bath, April 7</i>&mdash;The journey was very comfortable; Mr. Thrale
      was charmingly well and in very good spirits, and Mrs. Thrale must be
      charming, well or ill. We only went to Maidenhead Bridge the first night,
      where I found the caution given me by Mr. Smelt,<a href="#linknote-116"
       name="linknoteref-116" id="linknoteref-116">[116]</a> of not attempting to
      travel near Windsor on a hunting-day, was a very necessary one, as we were
      with difficulty accommodated even the day after the hunt; several
      stragglers remaining at all the inns, and we heard of nothing but the king
      and royal huntsmen and huntswomen. The second day we slept at Speen Hill,
      and the third day we reached Devizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here Mrs. Thrale and I were much pleased with our hostess, Mrs.
      Laurence, who seemed something above her station in her inn. While we were
      at cards before supper, we were much surprised by the sounds of a
      pianoforte. I jumped up, and ran to listen whence it proceeded. I found it
      came from the next room, where the overture to the &ldquo;Buona Figliuola&rdquo; was
      performing. The playing was very decent, but as the music was not quite
      new to me, my curiosity was not whole ages in satisfying, and therefore I
      returned to finish the rubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't I begin to talk in an old-cattish manner of cards?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, another deal was hardly played, ere we heard the sound of a voice,
      and out I ran again. The singing, however, detained me not long, and so
      back I whisked; but the performance, however indifferent in itself yet'
      surprised us at the Bear however indifferent in itself, yet surprised us
      at Devizes, and therefore Mrs. Thrale determined to know from whom it
      came. Accordingly, she tapped at the door. A very handsome girl, about
      thirteen years old, with fine dark hair upon a finely-formed forehead,
      opened it. Mrs. Thrale made an apology for her intrusion, but the poor
      girl blushed and retreated into a corner of the room: another girl,
      however, advanced, and obligingly and gracefully invited us in and gave us
      all chairs. She was just sixteen extremely pretty, and with a countenance
      better than her features, though those were also very good. Mrs. Thrale
      made her many compliments, which she received with a mingled modesty and
      pleasure, both becoming and interesting. She was, indeed, a sweetly
      pleasing girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found they were both daughters of our hostess, and born and bred at
      Devizes. We were extremely pleased with them, and made them a long visit,
      which I wished to have been longer. But though those pretty girls struck
      us so much, the wonder of the family was yet to be produced. This was
      their brother, a most lovely boy of ten years of age who seems to be not
      merely the wonder of their family, but of the times, for his astonishing
      skill in drawing.<a href="#linknote-117" name="linknoteref-117"
       id="linknoteref-117">[117]</a> They protest he has never had any
      instruction, yet showed us some of his productions that were really
      beautiful. Those that were copies were delightful, those of his own
      composition amazing, though far inferior. I was equally struck with the
      boy and his works.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found that he had been taken to town, and that all the painters had
      been very kind to him, and Sir Joshua Reynolds had pronounced him, the
      mother said, the most promising genius he had ever met with. Mr. Hoare has
      been so charmed with this sweet boy's drawings that he intends sending him
      to Italy with his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      This house was full of books, as well as paintings, drawings, and music
      and all the family seem not only ingenious and industrious, but amiable;
      added to which, they are strikingly handsome.

    <h2>
      LORD MULGRAVE ON THE &ldquo;SERVICES.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Bath.</i>&mdash;I shall now skip to our arrival at this beautiful city
      which I really admire more than I did, if possible, when I first saw it.
      The houses are so elegant, the streets are so beautiful, the prospects so
      enchanting, I could fill whole pages upon the general beauty of the place
      and country, but that I have neither time for myself, nor incitement for
      you, as I know nothing tires so much as description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Lord Mulgrave, Augustus Phipps, Miss Cooper, Dr.
      Harrington, and Dr. Woodward dined with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like Lord Mulgrave<a href="#linknote-118" name="linknoteref-118"
       id="linknoteref-118">[118]</a> very much. He has more wit, and a greater
      readiness of repartee, than any man I have met with this age. During
      dinner he was all brilliancy, but I drew myself into a little scrape with
      him, from which I much wanted some of his wit to extricate myself. Mrs.
      Thrale was speaking of the House of Commons, and lamenting that she had
      never heard any debates there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I cannot, for this General Johnson has turned us all
      out most barbarously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Johnson?&rdquo; repeated Lord Mulgrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, or colonel&mdash;I don't know what the man was, but I know he was no
      man of gallantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever he was,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;I hope he was a land officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so too, my lord,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; cried Mr. Thrale, &ldquo;it was Commodore Johnson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's bad, indeed,&rdquo; said Lord Mulgrave, laughing. &ldquo;I thought, by his
      manners, he had belonged to the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said I &ldquo;they were hardly polished enough for the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I said a demi-voix, and meant only for Mrs. Thrale, but Lord Mulgrave
      heard and drew up upon them, and pointing his finger at me with a
      threatening air, exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you speak, Miss Burney? What's this, indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all stared, and to be sure I rouged pretty high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;should be more respectful to be sure,
      for she has a brother at sea herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and for all her, we shall see him come back from
      Kamschatka as polished a beau as any he will find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jem! God send him safe back, polished or rough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mulgrave's brother Edmund is just entered into the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me t'other day,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;that he did not like the
      thoughts of being a parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Very well,' said I, 'you are old enough to choose for yourself; what
      will you be then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, a soldier,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A soldier? will you so? Why, then, the best thing you can do is to
      embark with your brother Henry immediately, for you won't know what to do
      in a regiment by yourself.' Well, no sooner said than done! Henry was just
      going to the West Indies in Lord Harrington's regiment, and Edmund ordered
      a chaise and drove to Portsmouth after him. The whole was settled in half
      an hour.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE BYRONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday</i>&mdash;We had Mrs. Byron and Augusta,<a href="#linknote-119"
       name="linknoteref-119" id="linknoteref-119">[119]</a> and Mrs. Lee, to
      spend the afternoon. Augusta opened her whole heart to me, as we sat
      together, and told me all the affairs of her family. Her brother, Captain
      George Byron, is lately returned from the West Indies, and has brought a
      wife with him from Barbadoes, though he was there only three weeks, and
      knew not this girl he has married till ten days before he left it!&mdash;a
      pleasant circumstance for this proud family!
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Byron seems destined for mortification and humiliation; yet such
      is her native fire, and so wonderful are her spirits, that she bears up
      against all calamity, and though half mad one day with sorrow and
      vexation, is fit the next to entertain an assembly of company;&mdash;and
      so to entertain them as to make the happiest person in the company, by
      comparison with herself, seem sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augusta is a very amiably ingenuous girl, and I love her the more for her
      love of her sisters: she talked to me of them all, but chiefly of Sophia,
      the youngest next to herself, but who, having an independent fortune, has
      quarrelled with her mother, and lives with one of her sisters, Mrs. Byron,
      who married a first cousin, And son of Lord Byron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Burney,&rdquo; she says continually, &ldquo;if you knew Sophy, you would
      never bear me! she is so much better than I am, and so handsome, and so
      good, and so clever,&mdash;and I used to talk to her of you by the hour
      together. She longs so to know you! 'Come,' she says, 'now tell me
      something more about your darling, Miss Burney.' But I ought to hope you
      may never see her, for if you did I should be so jealous.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Friday was a busy and comical day. We had an engagement of long standing,
      to drink tea with Miss L&mdash;, whither we all went, and a most queer
      evening did we spend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we entered, she and all her company were looking out of the window;
      however, she found us out in a few minutes, and made us welcome in a
      strain of delight and humbleness at receiving us, that put her into a
      flutter of spirits, from which she never recovered all the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fat, jolly mother took her seat at the top of the room; next to her
      sat a lady in a riding habit, whom I soon found to be Mrs. Dobson;<a
      href="#linknote-120" name="linknoteref-120" id="linknoteref-120">[120]</a>
      below her sat a gentlewoman, prim, upright, neat, and mean; and, next to
      her, sat another, thin, haggard, wrinkled, fine, and tawdry, with a
      thousand frippery ornaments and old-fashioned furbelows; she was
      excellently nick-named, by Mrs. Thrale, the Duchess of Monmouth. On the
      opposite side was placed Mrs. Thrale, and, next to her, Queeny. For my own
      part, little liking the appearance of the set, and half dreading Mrs.
      Dobson, from whose notice I wished to escape, I had made up myself to one
      of the now deserted windows, and Mr. Thrale had followed me. As to Miss L&mdash;,
      she came to stand by me, and her panic, I fancy, returned, for she seemed
      quite panting with a desire to say something, and an incapacity to utter
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved happy for me that I had taken this place, for in a few minutes
      the mean, neat woman, whose name was Aubrey, asked if Miss Thrale was Miss
      Thrale?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, ma'am, who is that other young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A daughter of Dr. Burney's, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Dobson, &ldquo;is that the lady that has favoured us with
      that excellent novel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then burst forth a whole volley from all at once. &ldquo;Very extraordinary,
      indeed!&rdquo; said one;&mdash;&ldquo;Dear heart, who'd have thought it?&rdquo; said
      another,&mdash;&ldquo;I never saw the like in my life!&rdquo; said a third. And Mrs.
      Dobson, entering more into detail, began praising it through, but chiefly
      Evelina herself, which she said was the most natural character she had
      ever met in any book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Whalley now arrived, and I was obliged to go to a chair&mdash;when
      such staring followed; they could not have opened their eyes wider when
      they first looked at the Guildhall giants! I looked with all the gravity
      and demureness possible, in order to keep them from coming plump to the
      subject again, and, indeed this, for a while, kept them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, Dr. Harrington<a href="#linknote-121" name="linknoteref-121"
       id="linknoteref-121">[121]</a> arrived, which closed our party. Miss L&mdash;
      went whispering to him, and then came up to me, with a look of dismay, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ma'am, I'm so prodigiously concerned; Mr. Henry won't come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Henry, ma'am, the doctor's son. But, to be sure, he does not know you
      are here, or else&mdash;but I'm quite concerned, indeed, for here now we
      shall have no young gentlemen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, all the better,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I hope we shall be able to do very well
      without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, ma'am, to be sure. I don't mean for any common young gentlemen;
      but Mr. Henry, ma'am, it's quite another thing;&mdash;however, I think he
      might have come but I did not happen to mention in my card that you was to
      be here, and so&mdash;but I think it serves him right for not coming to
      see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the mamma hobbled to me, and began a furious Panegyric upon my
      book, saying at the same time,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, Miss, how you could get at them low characters. As to the lords
      and ladies, that's no wonder at all; but, as to t'others, why, I have not
      stirred night nor morning while I've been reading it; if I don't wonder
      how you could be so clever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And much, much more. And, scarcely had she unburthened herself, ere Miss L&mdash;trotted
      back to me, crying, in a tone of mingled triumph and vexation,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma'am, Mr. Henry will be very much mortified when he knows who has
      been here; that he will, indeed; however, I'm sure he deserves it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made some common sort of reply, that I hoped he was better engaged,
      which she vehemently declared was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now some music. Miss L&mdash; sung various old elegies of Jackson,
      Dr. Harrington, and Linley, and O how I dismalled in hearing them! Mr.
      Whalley, too, sung &ldquo;Robin Gray,&rdquo; and divers other melancholic ballads, and
      Miss Thrale Sang &ldquo;Ti seguiro fedele.&rdquo; But the first time there was a
      cessation of harmony, Miss L&mdash; again respectfully approaching me,
      cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O well, all my comfort is that Mr. Henry will be prodigiously mortified!
      But there's a ball to-night, so I suppose he's gone to that. However, I'm
      sure if he had known of meeting you young ladies here&mdash;but it's all
      good enough for him, for not coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;if meeting young ladies is a motive with him, he can have
      nothing to regret while at a ball, where he will see many more than he
      could here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ma'am, as to that&mdash;but I say no more, because it mayn't be
      proper; but, to be sure, if Mr. Henry had known&mdash;however, he'll be
      well mortified!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not two minutes relieved, ere Miss I&mdash;returned, to again assure
      me how glad she was that Mr. Henry would be mortified. The poor lady was
      quite heart-broken that we did not meet.

    <h2>
      ALL THE BEST FAMILIES IN THE NAVY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Lord Mulgrave called this morning. He is returned to
      Bath for only a few days. He was not in his usual spirits; yet he failed
      not to give me a rub for my old offence, which he seems determined not to
      forget; for upon something being said, to which, however, I had not
      attended, about seamen, he cast an arch glance at me, and cried out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, I know, will take our parts&mdash;if I remember right, she
      is one of the greatest of our enemies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the sea captains,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;fall upon Miss Burney: Captain
      Cotton, my cousin, was for ever plaguing her about her spite to the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was for the character of Captain Mirvan,<a
      href="#linknote-122" name="linknoteref-122" id="linknoteref-122">[122]</a>
      which, in a comical and good-humoured way, Captain Cotton pretended highly
      to resent, and so, he told me, did all the captains in the navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augusta Byron, too, tells me that the admiral, her father, very often
      talks of Captain Mirvan, and though the book is very high in his favour,
      is not half pleased with the captain's being such a brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I have this to comfort me&mdash;that the more I see of sea
      captains, the less reason I have to be ashamed of Captain Mirvan; for they
      have all so irresistible a propensity to wanton mischief&mdash;to roasting
      beaus, and detesting old women, that I quite rejoice I showed the book to
      no one ere printed, lest I should have been prevailed upon to soften his
      character. Some time after, while Lord Mulgrave was talking of Captain G.
      Byron's marrying a girl at Barbadoes, whom he had not known a week, he
      turned suddenly to me, and called out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Miss Burney, what you have to expect&mdash;your brother will bring a
      bride from Kamschatka, without doubt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;may perhaps be as well as a Hottentot, for when he was
      last out, he threatened us with a sister from the Cape of Good Hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday,</i>&mdash;Lord Mulgrave and Dr. Harrington dined here. Lord
      Mulgrave was delightful;&mdash;his wit is of so gay, so forcible, so
      splendid a kind that when he is disposed to exert it, he not only
      engrosses attention from all the rest of the company, but demands the full
      use of all one's faculties to keep pace in understanding the speeches,
      allusions, and sarcasms which he sports. But he will never, I believe, be
      tired of attacking me about the sea; &ldquo;he will make me 'eat it that leak,&rdquo;
       I assure <i>you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      During dinner he was speaking very highly of a sea officer whose name, I
      think, was Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Thrale, to which his lordship answered,
      &ldquo;Brother to Lord&mdash;something, but I forget what;&rdquo; and then, laughing
      and looking at me, he added, &ldquo;We have all the great families in the navy&mdash;ay,
      and all the best families, too,&mdash;have we not, Miss Burney? The sea is
      so favourable an element to genius, that there all high-souled younger
      brothers with empty pockets are sure of thriving: nay, I can say even more
      for it, for it not only fosters the talents of the spirited younger
      brothers, it also lightens the dullness even of that poor animal&mdash;an
      elder brother; so that it is always the most desirable place both for best
      and worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your lordship is always ready to praise it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;and
      I only wish we had a few more like you in the service,&mdash;and long may
      you live, both to defend and to ornament it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defence,&rdquo; answered he with quickness, &ldquo;it does not want, and, for
      ornament, it is above all!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE LADY OF BATH EASTON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;In the afternoon we all went to the Whalleys, where
      we found a large and a highly dressed company, at the head of which sat
      Lady Miller.<a href="#linknote-123" name="linknoteref-123"
       id="linknoteref-123">[123]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as my discourse was over with Mr. Whalley, Lady Miller arose, and
      went to Mrs. Thrale, and whispered something to her. Mrs. Thrale then
      rose, too, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your ladyship will give me leave, I will first introduce my daughter
      to you&rdquo;&mdash;making Miss Thrale, who was next her mother, make her
      reverences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;Miss Burney, Lady Miller desires to be
      introduced to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up I jumped and walked forward; Lady Miller, very civilly, more than met
      me half way, and said very polite things, of her wish to know me, and
      regret that she had not sooner met me, and then we both returned to our
      seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know now that notwithstanding Bath Easton is so much laughed at in
      London, nothing here is more tonish than to visit Lady Miller, who is
      extremely curious in her company, admitting few people who are not of rank
      or of fame, and excluding of those all who are not people of character
      very unblemished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, Lady Miller took a seat next mine on the sofa, to play at
      cards, and was excessively civil indeed&mdash;scolded Mrs. Thrale for not
      sooner making us acquainted, and had the politeness to offer to take me to
      the balls herself, as she heard Mr. and Mrs. Thrale did not choose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all this, it is hardly fair to tell you what I think of her.
      However, the truth is, I always, to the best of my intentions, speak
      honestly what I think of the folks I see, without being biassed either by
      their civilities or neglect; and that you will allow is being a very
      faithful historian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, Lady Miller is a round, plump, coarse looking dame of about
      forty, and while all her aim is to appear an elegant woman of fashion, all
      her success is to seem an ordinary woman in very common life, with fine
      clothes on. Her manners are bustling, her air is mock-important, and her
      manners very inelegant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the lady of Bath Easton; who, however, seems extremely
      good-natured, and who is, I am sure, extremely civil.

    <h2>
      A FASHIONABLE CONCERT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>June 4.</i>&mdash;To go on with Saturday evening. We left the Whalleys
      at nine, and then proceeded to Sir J. C&mdash;, who had invited us to a
      concert at his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found such a crowd of chairs and carriages we could hardly make our
      way. I had never seen any of the family, consisting of Sir J. and three
      daughters, but had been particularly invited. The two rooms for the
      company were quite full when we arrived, and a large party was standing
      upon the first floor landing-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I got up stairs, I was much surprised to hear my name called by a
      man's voice, who stood in the crowd upon the landing-place, and who said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, better go up another flight (pointing up stairs)&mdash;if
      you'll take my advice, you'll go up another flight, for there's no room
      anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then recollected the voice, for I could not see the face, of Lord
      Mulgrave, and I began at first to suppose I must really do as he said, for
      there seemed not room for a sparrow, and I have heard the Sharp family do
      actually send their company all over their house when they give concerts.
      However, by degrees we squeezed ourselves into the outer room, and then
      Mrs. Lambart made way up to me, to introduce me to Miss C&mdash;, who is
      extremely handsome, genteel, and pleasing, though tonish, and who did the
      honours, in spite of the crowd, in a manner to satisfy everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, she herself introduced me to her next sister, Arabella, who is
      very fat, but not ugly. As to Sir J., He was seated behind a door in the
      music-room, where, being lame, he was obliged to keep still, and I never
      once saw his face, though I was upon the point of falling over him; for,
      at one time, as I had squeezed just into the music-room, and was leaning
      against the door, which was open, and which Lord Althorp, the Duchess of
      Devonshire's brother, was also lolling against, the pressure pushed Sir
      James's chair, and the door beginning to move, I thought we should have
      fallen backwards. Lord Althorp moved off instantly, and I started forwards
      without making any disturbance, and then Mr. Travell came to assure me all
      was safe behind the door, and so the matter rested quietly, though not
      without giving me a ridiculous fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Travell, ma'am, if I have not yet introduced him to you, I must tell
      you&mdash;'is known throughout Bath by the name of Beau Travell; he is a
      most approved connoisseur in beauty, gives the ton to all the world, sets
      up young ladies in the beau monde, and is the sovereign arbitrator of
      fashions, and decider of fashionable people. I had never the honour of
      being addressed by him before, though I have met him at the dean's and at
      Mrs. Lainbart's. So you may believe I was properly struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the rooms were so crowded, I saw but two faces I knew&mdash;Lord
      Huntingdon, whom I have drank tea with at Mrs. Cholmley's.<a
      href="#linknote-124" name="linknoteref-124" id="linknoteref-124">[124]</a>
      and Miss Philips; but the rest were all showy tonish people, who are only
      to be seen by going to the rooms, which we never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, Lord Mulgrave crowded in among us, and cried out to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you would not take my advice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him he had really alarmed me, for I had taken him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at the notion of sending me up to the garrets, and then poked
      himself into the concert-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, but I forgot to mention Dr. Harrington, with whom I 'had much
      conversation, and who was dry, comical, and very agreeable. I also saw Mr.
      Henry, but as Miss L&mdash; was not present, nothing ensued.<a
      href="#linknote-125" name="linknoteref-125" id="linknoteref-125">[125]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss C&mdash; herself brought me a cup of ice, the room being crowded that
      the man could not get near me. How ridiculous to invite so many more
      people than could be accommodated! Lord Mulgrave was soon sick of the
      heat, and finding me distressed what to do with my cup, he very good&mdash;naturedly
      took it from me, but carried not only that, but himself also, away, which
      I did not equally rejoice at.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may laugh, perhaps, that I have all this time said never a word of the
      music, but the truth is I heard scarce a note. There were quartettos and
      overtures by gentlemen performers whose names and faces I know not, and
      such was the never ceasing rattling and noise in the card-room, where I
      was kept almost all the evening, that a general humming of musical sounds,
      and now and then a twang, was all I could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can well be more ridiculous than a concert of this sort; and Dr.
      Harrington told me that the confusion amongst the musicians was equal to
      that amongst the company; for that, when called upon to open the concert,
      they found no music. The Miss C&mdash;'s had prepared nothing, nor yet
      solicited their dilettante's to prepare for them. Miss Harrington, his
      daughter, who played upon the harpsichord, and by the very little I could
      sometimes hear, I believe very well, complained that she had never touched
      so vile an instrument, and that she was quite disturbed at being obliged
      to play upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the time that I got against the door, as I have mentioned, of the
      music room, the young ladies were preparing to perform, and with the
      assistance of Mr. Henry, they sang catches. Oh, such singing! worse
      squalling, more out of tune, and more execrable in every respect, never
      did I hear. We did not get away till late.

    <h2>
      A BATH ALDERMAN'S RAREE SHOW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;We had an excellent sermon from the Bishop of
      Peterborough, who preached merely at the request of Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner we had the bishop and Dr. Harrington; and the bishop, who was in
      very high spirits, proposed a frolic, which was, that we should all go to
      Spring Gardens, where he should give us tea, and thence proceed to Mr.
      Ferry's, to see a very curious house and garden. Mrs. Thrale pleaded that
      she had invited company to tea at home, but the bishop said we would go
      early, and should return in time, and was so gaily authoritative that he
      gained his point. He had been so long accustomed to command, as master of
      Westminster school, that he cannot prevail with himself, I believe, ever
      to be overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Harrington was engaged to a patient, and could not be of our party.
      But the three Thrales, the bishop and I, pursued our scheme, crossed the
      Avon, had a sweet walk through the meadows, and drank tea at Spring
      Gardens, where the bishop did the honours with a spirit, a gaiety, and an
      activity that jovialised us all, and really we were prodigiously lively.
      We then walked on to Mr. Ferry's habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferry is a Bath alderman; his house and garden exhibit the house and
      garden of Mr. Tattersall, enlarged. Just the same taste prevails, the same
      paltry ornaments, the same crowd of buildings, the same unmeaning
      decorations, and the same unsuccessful attempts at making something of
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept us half an hour in the garden, while they were preparing for our
      reception in the house, where after parading through four or five little
      vulgarly showy closets, not rooms, we were conducted into a very gaudy
      little apartment, where the master of the house sat reclining on his arm,
      as if in contemplation, though everything conspired to show that the house
      and its inhabitants were carefully arranged for our reception. The bishop
      had sent in his name by way of gaining admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop, with a gravity of demeanour difficult to himself to sustain,
      apologised for our intrusion, and returned thanks for seeing the house and
      garden. Mr. Ferry started from his pensive attitude, and begged us to be
      seated, and then a curtain was drawn, and we perceived through a glass a
      perspective view of ships, boats, and water. This raree-show over, the
      maid who officiated as show-woman had a hint given her and presently a
      trap-door opened, and up jumped a covered table, ornamented with various
      devices. When we had expressed our delight at this long enough to satisfy
      Mr. Ferry, another hint was given, and presently down dropped an eagle
      from the ceiling whose talons were put into a certain hook in the top of
      the covering of the table, and when the admiration at this was over, up
      again flew the eagle, conveying in his talons the cover, and leaving under
      it a repast of cakes, sweetmeats, oranges, and jellies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our raptures upon this feat subsided, the maid received another
      signal, and then seated herself in an armchair, which presently sank down
      underground, and up in its room came a barber's block, with a vast
      quantity of black wool on it, and a high head-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, you may be sure, was more applauded than all the rest; we were en
      extase, and having properly expressed our gratitude, were soon after
      suffered to decamp.

    <h2>
      FLIGHTY CAPTAIN BOUCHIER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;This morning, by appointment, we met a party at the
      pump-room, thence to proceed to Spring Gardens, to a public breakfast. The
      folks, however, were not to their time, and we sallied forth only with the
      addition of Miss Weston and Miss Byron.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we entered the gardens Augusta, who had hold of my arm, called
      out, &ldquo;Ah! there's the man I danced with at the ball! and he plagued me to
      death, asking me if I liked this and that, and the other, and, when I said
      'No,' he asked me what I did like? So, I suppose he thought me a fool, and
      so indeed, I am! only you are so good to me that I wrote my sister Sophy
      word that you had almost made me quite vain; and she wrote to me t'other
      day a private letter, and told me how glad she was you were come back,
      for, indeed, I had written her word I should be quite sick of my life
      here, if it was not for sometimes seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman to whom she pointed presently made up to us, And I found he
      was Captain Bouchier, the same who had rattled away at Mr. Whalley's. He
      instantly joined Miss Weston and consequently our party, and was in the
      same style of flighty raillery as before. He seems to have a very good
      understanding, and very quick parts, but he is rather too conscious of
      both however, he was really very entertaining, and as he abided wholly by
      Miss Weston, whose delicacy gave way to gaiety and flash, whether she
      would or not, I was very glad that he made one among us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the company soon came, and were Mr. and Mrs. Whalley, Mrs.
      Lambart, Mrs. Aubrey, Colonel Campbell, an old officer and old
      acquaintance of Mr. Thrale, and some others, both male and female, whose
      names I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all sat in one box, but we had three tea-makers. Miss Weston presided
      at that to which I belonged, and Augusta, Captain Bouchier, and herself
      were of our set. And gay enough we were, for the careless rattle of
      Captain Bouchier, which paid no regard to the daintiness of Miss Weston,
      made her obliged in her own defence, to abate her finery, and laugh, and
      rally, and rail, in her turn. But, at 'last, I really began to fear that
      this flighty officer would bring on a serious quarrel, for, among other
      subjects he was sporting, he unfortunately started that of the Bath Easton
      vase, which he ridiculed without mercy, and yet, according to all I have
      heard of it, without any injustice; but Mrs. Whalley, who overheard him,
      was quite irritated with him. Sir John an Lady Miller are her friends, and
      she thought it incumbent upon her to vindicate even this vain folly, which
      she did weakly and warmly, while Captain Bouchier only laughed and
      ridiculed them the more. Mrs. Whalley then coloured, and grew quite
      enraged, reasoning upon the wickedness of laughing at her good friends,
      and talking of generosity and sentiment. Meanwhile, he scampered from side
      to side to avoid her; laughed, shouted, and tried every way of braving it
      out; but was compelled at last to be serious, and enter into a solemn
      defence of his intentions, which were, he said, to ridicule the vase, not
      the Millers.

    <h2>
      A YOUNG AND AGREEABLE INFIDEL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;The party was Mr. and Mrs. Vanbrugh&mdash;the
      former a good sort of man&mdash;the latter, Captain Bouchier says, reckons
      herself a woman of humour, but she kept it prodigious snug; Lord
      Huntingdon, a very deaf old lord Sir Robert Pigot, a very thin old
      baronet; Mr. Tyson, a very civil master of the ceremonies; Mr. and Mrs.
      White, a very insignificant couple; Sir James C&mdash;, a bawling old man;
      two Misses C&mdash;, a pair of tonish misses; Mrs. and Miss Byron; Miss W&mdash;,
      and certain others I knew nothing of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augusta Byron, according to custom, had entered into conversation with me,
      and we were talking about her sisters, and her affairs, when Mr. E&mdash;-(whose
      name I forgot to mention) came to inform me that Mrs. Lambart begged to
      speak to me. She was upon a sofa with Miss W&mdash;, who, it seemed,
      desired much to be introduced to me, and so I took a chair facing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss W&mdash; is young and pleasing in her appearance, not pretty, but
      agreeable in her face, and soft, gentle, and well bred in her manners. Our
      conversation, for some time, was upon the common Bath topics; but when
      Mrs. Lambart left us&mdash;called to receive more company&mdash;we went
      insensibly into graver matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I soon found, by the looks and expressions of this young lady that she
      was of a peculiar cast, I left all choice of subjects to herself,
      determined quietly to follow as she led; and very soon, and I am sure I
      know not how, we had for topics the follies and vices of mankind, and,
      indeed, she spared not for lashing them. The women she rather excused than
      defended, laying to the door of the men their faults and imperfections;
      but the men, she said, were all bad&mdash;all, in one word, and without
      exception, sensualists.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared much at a severity of speech for which her softness of manner had
      so ill prepared me; and she, perceiving my surprise, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I ought to apologise for speaking my opinion to you&mdash;you,
      who have so just and so uncommon a knowledge of human nature. I have long
      wished ardently to have the honour of conversing with you; but your party
      has, altogether, been regarded as so formidable, that I have not had
      courage to approach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made&mdash;as what could I do else?&mdash;disqualifying speeches, and
      she then led to discoursing of happiness and misery: the latter she held
      to be the invariable lot of us all; and &ldquo;one word,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;we have in
      our language, and in all others, for which there is never any essential
      necessity, and that is pleasure!&rdquo; And her eyes filled with tears as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you amaze me!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;I have met with misanthropes before, but
      never with so complete a one; and I can hardly think I hear right when I
      see how young you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then, in rather indirect terms, gave me to understand that she was
      miserable at home, and in very direct terms, that she was wretched abroad;
      and openly said, that to affliction she was born, and in affliction she
      must die, for that the world was so vilely formed as to render happiness
      impossible for its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in this freedom of repining that I could by no means
      approve, and, as I found by all her manner that she had a disposition to
      even respect whatever I said, I now grew very serious, and frankly told
      her that I could not think it consistent with either truth or religion to
      cherish such notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;there is, which I believe might make me happy,
      but for that I have no inclination: it is an amorous disposition; but that
      I do not possess. I can make myself no happiness by intrigue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, indeed!&rdquo; cried I, almost confounded by her extraordinary
      notions and speeches; &ldquo;but, surely, there are worthier objects of
      happiness attainable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe there are not, and the reason the men are happier than us,
      is because they are more sensual!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not think such thoughts,&rdquo; cried I, clasping my hands with an
      involuntary vehemence, &ldquo;for worlds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Misses C&mdash; then interrupted us, and seated themselves next to us;
      but Miss W&mdash; paid them little attention at first, and soon after none
      at all; but, in a low voice, continued her discourse with me, recurring to
      the same subject of happiness and misery, upon which, after again
      asserting the folly of ever hoping for the former, she made this speech,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be, indeed, one moment of happiness, which must be the finding
      one worthy of exciting a passion which one should dare own to himself.
      That would, indeed, be a moment worth living for! but that can never
      happen&mdash;I am sure not to me&mdash;the men are so low, so vicious, so
      worthless! No, there is not one such to be found!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a strange girl! I could do little more than listen to her, from
      surprise at all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, however,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I had your talents I could, bad as this
      world is, be happy in it. There is nothing, there is nobody I envy like
      you. With such resources as yours there can never be ennui; the mind may
      always be employed, and always be gay! Oh, if I could write as you write!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that is all that is wanting! try, and you will soon do
      much better things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no! I have tried, but I cannot succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are too diffident. But is it possible you can be serious in
      so dreadful an assertion as that you are never happy? Are you sure that
      some real misfortune would not show you that your present misery is
      imaginary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered she, looking down, &ldquo;perhaps it is so,&mdash;but
      in that case 'tis a misery so much the harder to be cured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surprise me more and more,&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;is it possible you can so
      rationally see the disease of a disordered imagination, and yet allow it
      such power over your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for it is the only source from which I draw any shadow of felicity.
      Sometimes when in the country, I give way to my imagination for whole
      days, and then I forget the world and its cares, and feel some enjoyment
      of existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what is then your notion of felicity? Whither does your
      castle-building carry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, quite out of the world&mdash;I know not where, but I am surrounded
      with sylphs, and I forget everything besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are a most extraordinary character, indeed; I must confess I
      have seen nothing like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, however, I shall find something like myself, and, like the magnet
      rolling in the dust, attract some metal as I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may attract what you please, is of all things the most likely;
      but if you wait to be happy for a friend resembling yourself, I shall no
      longer wonder at your despondency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried she, raising her eyes in ecstasy, &ldquo;could I find such a one!&mdash;male
      or female&mdash;for sex would be indifferent to me. With such a one I
      would go to live directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I half laughed, but was perplexed in my own mind whether to be sad or
      merry at such a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;after making, should I lose such a friend, I
      would not survive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not survive?&rdquo; repeated I, &ldquo;what can you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked down, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you cannot mean,&rdquo; said I, very gravely indeed, &ldquo;to put a violent
      end to your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not,&rdquo; said she, again looking up, &ldquo;hesitate a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was quite thunderstruck, and for some time could not say a word; but
      when I did speak, it was in a style of exhortation so serious and earnest,
      I am ashamed to write it to you, lest you should think it too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me an attention that was even respectful, but when I urged her to
      tell me by what right she thought herself entitled to rush unlicensed on
      eternity, she said, &ldquo;By the right of believing I shall be extinct.&rdquo; I
      really felt horror-struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, for heaven's sake,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;where have you picked up such
      dreadful reasoning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Hume,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have read his Essays repeatedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to find they have power to do so much mischief; you should not
      have read them, at least till a man equal to Hume in abilities had
      answered him. Have you read any more infidel writers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Bolingbroke, the divinest of all writers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you read nothing upon the right side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the bible, till I was sick to death of it, every Sunday evening to
      my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Have you read Beattie on the Immutability of Truth?"<a href="#linknote-126"
       name="linknoteref-126" id="linknoteref-126">[126]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me leave then to recommend it to you. After Hume's Essays you ought
      to read it. And even for lighter reading, if you were to look at Mason's
      'Elegy on Lady Coventry,' it might be of no disservice to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the chief of our conversation, which indeed made an impression
      upon me I shall not easily get rid of. A young and agreeable infidel is
      even a shocking sight, and with her romantic, flighty, and unguarded turn
      of mind, what could happen to her that could give surprise?

    <h2>
      BALL-ROOM FLIRTATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday.</i>&mdash;In the evening was the last ball expected to be at
      Bath this season, and therefore knowing we could go to no other, it was
      settled we should go to this. Of our party were Mrs. Byron and Augusta,
      Miss Philips, and Charlotte Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Byron was placed at the upper end of the room by Mr. Tyson, because
      she is honourable, and her daughter next to her; I, of course, the lowest
      of our party; but the moment Mr. Tyson had arranged us, Augusta arose, and
      nothing would satisfy her but taking a seat not only next to but below me;
      nor could I for my life get the better of the affectionate humility with
      which she quite supplicated me to be content. She was soon after followed
      by Captain Brisbane, a young officer who had met her in Spring Gardens,
      and seemed much struck with her, and was now presented to her by Mr. Tyson
      for her partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Brisbane is a very pretty sort of young man, but did not much
      enliven us. Soon after I perceived Captain Bouchier, who, after talking
      some time with Mrs. Thrale, and various parties, made up to us, and upon
      Augusta's being called upon to dance a minuet, took her place, and began a
      very lively sort of chit-chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had, however, no small difficulty to keep him from abusing my friend
      Augusta. He had once danced with her, and their commerce had not been much
      to her advantage. I defended her upon the score of her amiable simplicity
      and unaffected ingenuousness, but I could not have the courage to
      contradict him when he said he had no notion she was very brilliant by the
      conversation he had had with her. Augusta, indeed, is nothing less than
      brilliant: but she is natural, artless, and very affectionate. Just before
      she went to dance her minuet, upon my admiring her bouquet, which was the
      most beautiful in the room, she tore from it the only two moss roses in
      it, and so spoilt it all before her exhibition, merely that I might have
      the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Country dances were now preparing, and after a little further chat,
      Captain Bouchier asked me for the honour of my hand, but I had previously
      resolved not to dance, and therefore declined his offer. But he took, of
      the sudden, a fancy to prate with me, and therefore budged not after the
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me this was the worst ball for company there had been the whole
      season; and, with a wicked laugh that was too significant to be
      misunderstood, said, &ldquo;And, as you have been to no other, perhaps you will
      give this for a specimen of a Bath ball!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told me he had very lately met with Hannah More, and then mentioned
      Mrs. Montagu and Mrs. Carter, whence he took occasion to say most high and
      fine things of the ladies of the present age,&mdash;their writings, and
      talents; and I soon found he had no small reverence for us blue-stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Charlotte,<a href="#linknote-127" name="linknoteref-127"
       id="linknoteref-127">[127]</a> who had confessedly dressed herself for
      dancing, but whose pretty face had by some means been overlooked, drawled
      towards us, and asked me why I would not dance?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never intended it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I hoped to have seen you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, yawning, &ldquo;no more shall I,&mdash;I don't choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo; said Captain Bouchier, dryly, &ldquo;why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because I don't like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O fie!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;consider how cruel that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must consider myself,&rdquo; said she, pertly; &ldquo;for I don't choose to heat
      myself this hot weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a young man came forward, and requested her hand. She coloured,
      looked excessively silly, and walked off with him to join the dancers.
      When, between the dances, she came our way, he plagued her, a la Sir
      Clement.<a href="#linknote-128" name="linknoteref-128" id="linknoteref-128">[128]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;so you have been dancing this hot night! I thought you
      would have considered yourself better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I could not help it&mdash;I had much rather not;&mdash;it
      was quite disagreeable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;pardon me there!&rdquo; said he, maliciously; &ldquo;I saw pleasure
      dance first in your eyes; I never saw you look more delighted: you were
      quite the queen of smiles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked as if she could have killed him; and yet, from giddiness and
      good-humour, was compelled to join in the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this we went to tea. When that was over, and we all returned to the
      ball-room, Captain Bouchier followed me, and again took a seat next mine,
      which he kept, without once moving, the whole night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He again applied to me to dance, but I was more steady than Charlotte; and
      he was called upon, and reproached by Captain Brisbane and others for
      sitting still when there were so few dancers; but he told them he could
      not endure being pressed into the service, or serving at all under the
      master of the ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I have no more time for particulars, though we had much more
      converse; for so it happened that we talked all the evening almost
      together, as Mrs. Thrale and Mrs. Byron were engaged with each other: Miss
      Thrale, who did not dance, was fairly jockeyed out of her place next me by
      Captain Bouchier, and the other young ladies were with their partners.
      Before we broke up, this captain asked me if I should be at the play next
      night?&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I could not but say, as we had had places taken some
      time; but I did not half like it, for his manner of asking plainly
      implied, &ldquo;If you go, why I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we made our exit, he saw me safe out of the rooms, with as much
      attention as if we had actually been partners. As we were near home we did
      not get into chairs; and Mr. Travell joined us in our walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what a flirtation,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale; &ldquo;why, Burney, this is a man
      of taste!&mdash;Pray, Mr. Travell, will it do? What has he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand pounds, ma'am,&rdquo; answered the beau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ho! has he so?&mdash;Well, well, we'll think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding her so facetious, I determined not to acquaint her with the query
      concerning the play, knowing that, if I did, and he appeared there, she
      would be outrageous in merriment. She is a most dear creature, but never
      restrains her tongue in anything, nor, indeed, any of her feelings:&mdash;she
      laughs, cries, scolds, sports, reasons, makes fun,&mdash;does everything
      she has an inclination to do, without any study of prudence, or thought of
      blame; and pure and artless as is this character, it often draws both
      herself and others into scrapes, which a little discretion would avoid.

    <h2>
      FURTHER FLIRTATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saturday morning I spent in visiting. At dinner we had Mrs. Lambart and
      Colonel Campbell. All the discourse was upon Augusta Byron's having made a
      conquest of Captain Brisbane, and the match was soon concluded upon,&mdash;at
      least, they all allowed it would be decided this night, when she was to go
      with us to the play; and if Captain Brisbane was there, why then he was in
      for it, and the thing was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;Augusta came at the usual time; Colonel Campbell took leave,
      but Mrs. Lambart accompanied us to the play: and, in the lobby, the first
      object we saw was Captain Brisbane. He immediately advanced to us, and,
      joining our party, followed us into our box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could equal the wickedness of Mrs. Thrale and Mrs. Lambart; they
      smiled at each other with such significance! Fortunately, however, Augusta
      did not observe them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we took our seats, and Captain Brisbane, by getting into the next
      box, on a line with ours, placed himself next to Augusta:<a
      href="#linknote-129" name="linknoteref-129" id="linknoteref-129">[129]</a>
      but hardly had Mrs. T. and L. composed their faces, ere I heard the
      box-door open. Every one looked round but me, and I had reasons for
      avoiding such curiosity,&mdash;reasons well enough founded, for instantly
      grins, broader than before, widened the mouths of the two married ladies,
      while even Miss Thrale began a titter that half choaked her, and Augusta,
      nodding to me with an arch smirk, said, &ldquo;Miss Burney, I wish you joy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be sure I could have no doubt who entered, but, very innocently, I
      demanded of them all the cause of their mirth. They scrupled not
      explaining themselves; and I found my caution, in not mentioning the query
      that had been put to me, availed me nothing, for the captain was already a
      marked man in my service!
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed himself exactly behind me, but very quietly and silently, and
      did not, for some minutes, speak to me; afterwards, however, he did a
      little,&mdash;except when my favourite, Mr. Lee, who acted Old Norval, in
      &ldquo;Douglas,&rdquo; was on the stage, and then he was strictly silent. I am in no
      cue to write our discourse; but it was pleasant and entertaining enough at
      the time, and his observations upon the play and the players were lively
      and comical. But I was prodigiously worried by my own party, who took
      every opportunity to inquire how I was entertained and so forth,&mdash;and
      to snigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two young ladies, who seemed about eighteen, and sat above us were so much
      shocked by the death of Douglas, that both burst into a loud fit of
      roaring, like little children,&mdash;and sobbed on, afterwards, for almost
      half the farce! I was quite astonished; and Miss Weston complained that
      they really disturbed her sorrows; but Captain Bouchier was highly
      diverted, and went to give them comfort, as if they had been babies,
      telling them it was all over, and that they need not cry any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monday.</i>&mdash;At breakfast, Mrs. Thrale said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you never tell me your love-secrets, but I could tell you one if I
      chose it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This produced entreaties&mdash;-and entreaties thus much further&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I know very well who is in love with Fanny Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her that was more than I did, but owned it was not difficult to
      guess who she meant, though I could not tell what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Bouchier,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But you did not tell me so, nor he either;
      I had it from Mr. Tyson, our master of the ceremonies, who told me you
      made a conquest of him at the ball; and he knows these matters pretty
      well; 'tis his trade to know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-a-day!&rdquo; quoth I&mdash;&ldquo;'tis unlucky we did not meet a little sooner,
      for this very day he is ordered away with his troop into Norfolk.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      BATH EASTON AND SCEPTICAL MISS W&mdash;&mdash;
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday, June 8.</i>&mdash;We went to Bath Easton. Mrs. Lambart went
      with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is charmingly situated, well fitted up, convenient, and
      pleasant, and not large, but commodious and elegant. Thursday is still
      their public day for company, though the business of the vase is over for
      this season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room into which we were conducted was so much crowded we could hardly
      make our way. Lady Miller came to the door, and, as she had first done to
      the rest of us, took my hand, and led me up to a most prodigious fat old
      lady, and introduced me to her. This was Mrs. Riggs, her ladyship's
      mother, who seems to have Bath Easton and its owners under her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was smiled upon with a graciousness designedly marked, and seemed most
      uncommonly welcome. Mrs. Riggs looked as if she could have shouted for joy
      at sight of me! She is mighty merry and facetious, Sir John was very
      quiet, but very civil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the place appropriated for the vase, but at this time it was
      removed. As it was hot, Sir John Miller offered us to walk round the
      house, and see his greenhouse, etc. So away we set off, Harriet Bowdler
      accompanying me, and some others following.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not strolled far ere we were overtaken by another party, and among
      them I perceived Miss W&mdash; my new sceptical friend. She joined me
      immediately, and I found she was by no means in so sad a humour as when I
      saw her last, on the contrary, she seemed flightily gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you never here before?&rdquo; she asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? why what an acquisition you are then! I suppose you will contribute
      to the vase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more you ought; you are quite too good for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that; but I have no great passion for making the trial. You, I
      suppose, have contributed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never&mdash;I can't. I have tried, but I could never write verses in
      my life&mdash;never get beyond Cupid and stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Cupid, then, always come in your way? what a mischievous urchin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has not been very mischievous to me this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this year? Oh, very well! He has spared you, then, for a whole
      twelvemonth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and we were interrupted by more company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, while I was talking with Miss W&mdash; and Harriet
      Bowdler, Mrs. Riggs came up to us, and with an expression of comical
      admiration, fixed her eyes upon me, and for some time amused herself with
      apparently watching me. Mrs. Lambart, who was at cards, turned round and
      begged me to give her her cloak, for she felt rheumatic; I could not
      readily find it, and, after looking some time, I was obliged to give her
      my own; but while I was hunting, Mrs. Riggs followed me, laughing,
      nodding, and looking much delighted, and every now and then saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Evelina&mdash;Ah! look for it, Evelina!&mdash;Evelina
      always did so&mdash;she always looked for people's cloaks, and was
      obliging and well-bred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I grinned a little, to be sure, but tried to escape her, by again getting
      between Miss W&mdash; and Harriet Bowdler; but Mrs. Riggs still kept
      opposite to me, expressing from time to time, by uplifted hands and eyes,
      comical applause, Harriet Bowdler modestly mumbled some praise, but
      addressed it to Miss Thrale. I begged a truce, and retired to a chair in a
      corner, at the request of Miss W&mdash; to have a tete-a-tete, for which,
      however, her strange levity gave me no great desire. She begged to know if
      I had written anything else. I assured her never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'Sylph,'&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am told, was yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had nothing at all to do with that or anything else that ever was
      published but 'Evelina;' you, I suppose, read the 'Sylph' for its name's
      sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I never read novels&mdash;I hate them; I never read 'Evelina' till I
      was quite persecuted by hearing it talked of. 'Sir Charles Grandison' I
      tried once, but could not bear it; Sir Charles for a lover! no lover for
      me! for a guardian or the trustee of an estate, he might do very well&mdash;but
      for a lover!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;when he bows upon your hand! would not that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept me by her side for a full hour, and we again talked over our
      former conversation; and I enquired what first led her to seeking infidel
      books?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pope,&rdquo; she said; he was himself a deist, she believed, and his praise of
      Bolingbroke made her mad to read his books, and then the rest followed
      easily. She also gave me an account of her private and domestic life; of
      her misery at home, her search of dissipation, and her incapability of
      happiness.

    <h2>
      CURIOSITY ABOUT THE &ldquo;EVELINA&rdquo; SET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our conversation would have lasted till leave-taking, but for our being
      interrupted by Miss Miller, a most beautiful little girl of ten years old.
      Miss W&mdash; begged her to sing us a French song. She coquetted, but Mrs.
      Riggs came to us, and said if I wished it I did her grand-daughter great
      honour, and she insisted upon her obedience. The little girl laughed and
      complied, and we went into another room to hear her, followed by the
      Misses Caldwell. She sung in a pretty childish manner enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we became more intimate, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am, I have a great favour to request of you, if you please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I begged to know what it was, and assured her I would grant it; and to be
      out of the way of these misses, I led her to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am,&rdquo; said the little girl, &ldquo;will you then be so good as to tell me
      where Evelina is now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was a little surprised at the question, and told her I had not heard
      lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ma'am, but I am sure you know!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;for you know you wrote
      it; and mamma was so good as to let me hear her read it; and pray, ma'am,
      do tell me where she is? and whether Miss Branghton and Miss Polly went to
      see her when she was married to Lord Orville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised her I would inquire, and let her know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, ma'am, is Madame Duval with her now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And several other questions she asked me, with a childish simplicity that
      was very diverting. She took the whole for a true story, and was quite
      eager to know what was become of all the people. And when I said I would
      inquire, and tell her when we next met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, ma'am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;had not you better write it down, because
      then there would be more of it, you know?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      ALARM AT THE &ldquo;NO POPERY&rdquo; RIOTS.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [The disgraceful &ldquo;No Popery&rdquo; riots, which filled London with
     terror, and the whole country with alarm, in June, 1780,
     were occasioned by the recent relaxation of the severe penal
     laws against the Catholics.  The rioters were headed by Lord
     George Gordon, a crazy enthusiast.  Dr. Johnson has given a
     lively account of the disturbance in his &ldquo;Letters to Mrs.
     Thrale,&rdquo; some excerpts from which will, perhaps, be not
     unacceptable to the reader.

     &ldquo;9th June, 1780. on Friday (June 2) the good protestants met
     in Saint George's Fields, at the summons of Lord George
     Gordon; and marching to Westminster, insulted the lords and
     commons, who all bore it with great tameness.  At night the
     outrages began by the demolition of the mass-house by
     Lincoln's Inn.

     &ldquo;An exact journal of a week's defiance of government I
     cannot give you.  On Monday Mr. Strahan, who had been
     insulted, spoke to Lord Mansfield, who had, I think, been
     insulted too, of the licentiousness of the populace; and his
     lordship treated it as a very slight irregularity.  On
     Tuesday night they pulled down Fielding's<a href="#linknote-130"
       name="linknoteref-130" id="linknoteref-130">[130]</a> house, and
     burnt his goods in the street.  They had gutted on Monday
     Sir George Savile's house, but the building was saved.  On
     Tuesday evening, leaving Fielding's ruins, they went to
     Newgate to demand their companions, who had been seized
     demolishing the chapel.  The keeper could not release them
     but by the mayor's permission, which he went to ask; at his
     return he found all the prisoners released, and Newgate in a
     blaze.  They then went to Bloomsbury, and fastened upon Lord
     Mansfield's house, which they pulled down; and as for his
     goods, they totally burnt them.  They have since gone to
     Caen-wood, but a guard was there before them. They plundered
     some papists, I think, and burnt a mass-house in Moorfields
     the same night.

     &ldquo;On Wednesday I walked with Dr. Scot to look at Newgate and
     found it in ruins, with the fire yet glowing.  As I went by,
     the Protestants were plundering the sessions-house at the
     Old Bailey. There were not, I believe, a hundred; but they
     did their work at leisure, in full security, without
     sentinels without trepidation, as men lawfully employed in
     full day.  Such is the cowardice of a commercial place.  On
     Wednesday they broke open the Fleet, and the King's Bench,
     and the Marshalsea, and Woodstreet Compter, and Clerkenwell
     Bridewell, and released all the prisoners.  At night they
     set fire to the Fleet, and to the King's Bench, and I know
     not how many other places; and one might see the glare of
     conflagration fill the sky from many parts.  The sight was
     dreadful.

     &ldquo;The King said in council, 'That the magistrates had not
     done their duty, but that he would do his own;' and a
     proclamation was published, directing us to keep our
     servants within doors, as the peace was now to be preserved
     by force.  The soldiers were sent out to different parts,
     and the town is now at quiet. What has happened at your
     house<a href="#linknote-131" name="linknoteref-131" id="linknoteref-131">[131]</a> you will know: the harm is only a few butts of
     beer; and, I think, you may be sure that the danger is
     over.&rdquo;

     10th June, 1780.  The soldiers are stationed so as to be
     everywhere within call.  There is no longer any body of
     rioters, and the individuals are hunted to their holes, and
     led to prison. Lord George was last night sent to the Tower.

     Government now acts again with its proper force&mdash;-and we are
     all under the protection of the King and the law.&mdash;ED.]
</pre>
    <p>
      When we came home our newspaper accounts of the tumults In town with Lord
      George Gordon and his mob, alarmed us very much; but we had still no
      notion of the real danger you were all in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day we drank tea with the Dowdlers. At our return home we were
      informed a mob was surrounding a new Roman Catholic chapel. At first we
      disbelieved it, but presently one of the servants came and told us they
      were knocking it to pieces; and in half an hour, looking out of our
      windows, we saw it in flames: and listening, we heard loud and violent
      shouts!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall write no particulars&mdash;the horrible subject you have had more
      than your share of. Mrs. Thrale and I sat up till four o'clock, and walked
      about the parades, and at two we went with a large party to the spot, and
      saw the beautiful new building consuming; the mob then were all quiet&mdash;all
      still and silent, and everybody seemed but as spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday morning, to my inexpressible concern, brought me no letters from
      town, and my uneasiness to hear from you made me quite wretched. Mrs.
      Thrale had letters from Sir Philip Clerke and Mr. Perkins, to acquaint her
      that her town-house had been three times attacked, but was at last saved
      by guards; her children, plate, money, and valuables all removed.
      Streatham also threatened, and emptied of all its furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same morning also we saw a Bath and Bristol paper, in which Mr. Thrale
      was asserted to be a papist. This villanous falsehood terrified us even
      for his personal safety, and Mrs. Thrale and I agreed it was best to leave
      Bath directly, and travel about the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left to me the task of acquainting Mr. Thrale with these particulars,
      being herself too much disturbed to be capable of such a task. I did it as
      well as I could, and succeeded so far that, by being lightly told of it,
      he treated it lightly, and bore it with much steadiness and composure. We
      then soon settled to decamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no time nor spirits pour prendre conge stuff, but determined to
      call upon the Bowdlers and Miss Cooper. They were all sorry to part, and
      Miss Cooper, to my equal surprise and pleasure, fairly made a declaration
      of her passion for me, assuring me she had never before taken so great a
      fancy to a new acquaintance, and beginning warmly the request I meant to
      make myself, of continuing our intimacy in town.

      FANNY BURNEY TO DR. BURNEY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bath, June 9, 1780,
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      How are you? where are you? and what is to come next? The accounts from
      town are so frightful, that I am uneasy, not only for the city at large,
      but for every individual I know in it. Does this martial law confine you
      quite to the house? Folks here say that it must, and that no business of
      any kind can be transacted. Oh, what dreadful times! Yet I rejoice
      extremely that the opposition members have fared little better than the
      ministerial. Had such a mob been confirmed friends of either or of any
      party, I think the nation must have been at their disposal; for, if headed
      by popular or skilful leaders, who and what could have resisted them?&mdash;I
      mean, if they are as formidable as we are here told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson has written to Mrs. Thrale, without even mentioning the
      existence of this mob; perhaps at this very moment he thinks it &ldquo;a humbug
      upon the nation,&rdquo; as George Bodens called the parliament,
    </p>
    <p>
      A private letter to Bull, the bookseller, brought word this morning that
      much slaughter has been made by the military among the mob. Never, I am
      sure, can any set of wretches less deserve quarter or pity; yet it is
      impossible not to shudder at hearing of their destruction. Nothing less,
      however, would do; they were too outrageous and powerful for civil power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is it they want? who is going to turn papist? who, indeed, is
      thinking in an alarming way of religion?&mdash;this pious mob, and George
      Gordon excepted?
    </p>
    <p>
      All the stage-coaches that come into Bath from London are chalked over
      with &ldquo;No Popery,&rdquo; and Dr. Harrington called here just now, and says the
      same was chalked this morning upon his door, and is scrawled in several
      places about the town. Wagers have been laid that the popish chapel here
      will be pulled or burnt down in a few days; but I believe not a word of
      the matter, nor do I find that anybody is at all alarmed. Bath, indeed,
      ought to be held sacred as a sanctuary for invalids; and I doubt not but
      the news of the firing in town will prevent all tumults out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if, after all the intolerable provocation given by the mob, after all
      the leniency and forbearance of the ministry, and after the shrinking Of
      the minority, we shall by and by hear that this firing was a massacre&mdash;will
      it not be villanous and horrible? And yet as soon as safety is secured&mdash;though
      by this means alone all now agree it can be secured&mdash;nothing would
      less surprise me than to hear the seekers of popularity make this
      assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friday night.</i>&mdash;The above I writ this morning, before I
      recollected this was not post-day, and all is altered here since. The
      threats I despised were but too well grounded, for, to our utter amazement
      and consternation, the new Roman Catholic chapel in this town was set on
      fire at about nine o'clock. It is now burning with a fury that is
      dreadful, and the house of the priest belonging to it is in flames also.
      The poor persecuted man himself has I believe escaped with life, though
      pelted, followed, and very ill used. Mrs. Thrale and I have been walking
      about with the footmen several times. The whole town is still and orderly.
      The rioters do their work with great composure, and though there are knots
      of people in every corner, all execrating the authors of such outrages,
      nobody dares oppose them. An attempt indeed was made, but it was
      ill-conducted, faintly followed, and soon put an end to by a secret fear
      of exciting vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! to what have we all lived!&mdash;the poor invalids here will
      probably lose all chance of life, from terror. Mr. Hay, our apothecary,
      has been attending the removal of two, who were confined to their beds in
      the street where the chapel is burning. The Catholics throughout the place
      are all threatened with destruction, and we met several porters, between
      ten and eleven at night, privately removing goods, walking on tiptoe, and
      scarcely breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I firmly believe, by the deliberate villany with which this riot is
      conducted, that it wil! go on in the same desperate way as in town, and
      only be stopped by the same desperate means. Our plan for going to Bristol
      is at an end. We are told it would be madness, as there are seven Romish
      chapels in it; but we are determined upon removing somewhere to-morrow;
      for why should we, who can go, stay to witness such horrid scenes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday Afternoon, June 10</i>&mdash;I was most cruelly disappointed
      in not having one word to-day. I am half crazy with doubt and disturbance
      in not hearing. Everybody here is terrified to death. We have intelligence
      that Mr. Thrale's house in town is filled with soldiers, and threatened by
      the mob with destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he may himself be a marked man for their fury. We are going
      directly from Bath, and intend to stop only at villages. To-night we shall
      stop at Warminster, not daring to go to Devizes. This place is now well
      guarded, but still we dare not await the event of to-night; all the
      catholics in the town have privately escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not now when I shall hear from you. I am in agony for news. Our
      head-quarters will be Brighthelmstone, where I do most humbly and
      fervently entreat you to write&mdash;do, dearest sir, write, if but one
      word&mdash;if but only you name yourself! Nothing but your own hand can
      now tranquillize me. The reports about London here quite distract me. If
      it were possible to send ine a line by the diligence to Brighton, how
      grateful I should be for such an indulgence!

    <h2>
      HASTY DEPARTURE FROM BATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FANNY BURNEY TO DR. BURNEY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salisbury, June 11, 1780
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we are, dearest sir, and here we mean to pass this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not leave Bath till eight o'clock yesterday evening, at which time
      it was filled with dragoons, militia, and armed constables, not armed with
      muskets, but bludgeons: these latter were all chairmen, who were sworn by
      the mayor in the morning for petty constables. A popish private chapel,
      and the houses of all the catholics, were guarded between seven and eight,
      and the inhabitants ordered to keep house.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set out in the coach-and-four, with two men on horseback, and got to
      Warminster, a small town in Somersetshire, a little before twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning two more servants came after us from Bath, and brought us
      word that the precautions taken by the magistrates last night had good
      success, for no attempt of any sort had been renewed towards a riot. But
      the happiest tidings to me were contained in a letter which they brought,
      which had arrived after our departure, by the diligence, from Mr. Perkins,<a
      href="#linknote-132" name="linknoteref-132" id="linknoteref-132">[132]</a>
      with an account that all was quiet in London, and that Lord G. Gordon was
      sent to the Tower. I am now again tolerably easy, but I shall not be
      really comfortable, or free from some fears, till I hear from St.
      Martin's-street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Borough house has been quite preserved. I know not how long we may be
      on the road, but nowhere long enough for receiving a letter till we come
      to Brighthelmstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stopped in our way at Wilton, and spent half the day at that beautiful
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before we arrived there, Lord Arundel had sent to the officers in the
      place, to entreat a party of guards immediately, for the safety of his
      house, as he had intelligence that a mob was on the road from London to
      attack it:&mdash;he is a catholic. His request was immediately complied
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      We intended to have gone to a private town, but find all quiet here, and
      therefore prefer it as much more commodious. There is no Romish chapel in
      the town; mass has always been performed for the catholics of the place at
      a Mrs. Arundel's in the Close&mdash;a relation of his lordship's, whose
      house is fifteen miles off. I have inquired about the Harris's;<a
      href="#linknote-133" name="linknoteref-133" id="linknoteref-133">[133]</a>
      I find they are here and all well.

      CHARLOTTE BURNEY<a href="#linknote-134" name="linknoteref-134"
       id="linknoteref-134">[134]</a> TO FANNY BURNEY.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very sorry, my dear Fanny, to hear how much you have suffered from
      your apprehension about us. Susan will tell you why none of us wrote
      before Friday; and she says, she has told you what dreadful havoc and
      devastation&mdash;the mob have made here in all parts of the town.
      However, we are pretty quiet and tranquil again now. Papa goes on with his
      business pretty much as usual, and so far from the military keeping people
      within doors (as you say in your letter to my father, you suppose to be
      the case), the streets were never more crowded&mdash;everybody is
      wandering about in order to see the ruins of the places that the mob have
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two camps, one in St. James's, and the other in Hyde Park, which
      together with the military law, makes almost every one here think he is
      safe again. I expect we shall all have &ldquo;a passion for a scarlet coat&rdquo; now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly know what to tell you that won't be stale news. They say that
      duplicates of the handbill that I have enclosed were distributed all over
      the town on Wednesday and Thursday last; however, thank heaven, everybody
      says now that Mr. Thrale's house and brewery are as safe as we can wish
      them. There was a brewer in Turnstile that had his house gutted and burnt,
      because, the mob said, &ldquo;he was a papish, and sold popish beer.&rdquo; Did you
      ever hear of such diabolical ruffians?
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to the pleasantness of our situation, there have been gangs of
      women going about to rob and plunder. Miss Kirwans went on Friday
      afternoon to walk in the Museum gardens, and were stopped by a set of
      women, and robbed of all the money they had. The mob had proscribed the
      mews, for they said, &ldquo;the king should not have a horse to ride upon!&rdquo; They
      besieged the new Somerset House, with intention to destroy it, but were
      repulsed by some soldiers placed there for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleepe has been here a day or two, and says the folks at Watford,
      where he comes from, &ldquo;approve very much Of having the Catholic chapels
      destroyed, for they say it's a shame the Pope should come here!&rdquo; There is
      a house hereabouts that they had chalked upon last week, &ldquo;Empty, and No
      Popery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am heartily rejoiced, my dearest Fanny, that you have got away from
      Bath, and hope and trust that at Brighthelmstone you will be as safe as we
      are here.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounds almost incredible, but they say, that on Wednesday night last,
      when the mob were more powerful, more numerous, and outrageous than ever,
      there was, nevertheless, a number of exceeding genteel people at Ranelagh,
      though they knew not but their houses might be on fire at the time!

      A SUGGESTED VISIT To GRUB-STREET.

    <p>
      FANNY BURNEY TO MRS. THRALE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I wrote last I have drunk tea with Dr. Johnson. My father took me to
      Bolt-court, and we found him, most fortunately, with only one brass-headed
      cane gentleman. Since that I have had the pleasure to meet him again at
      Mrs. Reynolds's, when he offered to take me with him to Grub-street, to
      see the ruins of the house demolished there in the late riots, by a mob
      that, as he observed, could be no friend to the Muses! He inquired if I
      had ever yet visited Grub-street? but was obliged to restrain his anger
      when I answered &ldquo;No,&rdquo; because he acknowledged he had never paid his
      respects to it himself. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you and I, Burney, will go
      together; we have a very good right to go, so we'll visit the mansions of
      our progenitors, and take up our own freedom, together.&rdquo; There's for you,
      madam! What can be grander?

      FANNY BURNEY to MRS. THRALE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chesington, Nov. 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no other adventure in London, but a most delightful incident has
      happened since I came hither. We had just done tea on Friday, and Mrs.
      Hamilton, Kitty, Jem, and Mr. Crisp, were sitting down to cards, when we
      were surprised by an express from London, and it brought a &ldquo;Whereas we
      think fit&rdquo; from the Admiralty, to appoint Captain Burney to the command of
      the &ldquo;Latona,&rdquo; during the absence of the Honourable Captain Conway. This is
      one of the best frigates in the navy, of thirty-eight guns, and
      immediately, I believe, ready for service. Jem was almost frantic with
      ecstacy of joy: he sang, laughed, drank to his own success, and danced
      about the room with Miss Kitty till He put her quite out of breath. His
      hope is to get out immediately, and have a brush with some of the Dons,
      Monsieurs, or Mynheers, while he is in possession of a ship of sufficient
      force to attack any frigate he may meet.

    <p>
      (Mrs. Thrale wrote to Fanny from Streatham, Dec. 22:&mdash;)
    </p>
    <p>
      I have picked up something to please you; Dr. Johnson pronounced an actual
      eulogium upon Captain Burney, to his yesterday's listeners&mdash;how
      amiable he was, and how gentle in his manner, etc., tho' he had lived so
      many years with sailors and savages.

      THE DEATH OF MR. THRALE.

      FANNY BURNEY to MRS. THRALE<a href="#linknote-135" name="linknoteref-135"
       id="linknoteref-135">[135]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday Evening, April 4, 1781
    </p>
    <p>
      You bid me write to you, and so I will; you bid me pray for you, and so,
      indeed, I do, for the restoration of your sweet peace of mind. I pray for
      your resignation to this hard blow, for the continued union and exertion
      of your virtues with your talents, and for the happiest reward their
      exertion can meet with, in the gratitude and prosperity of your children.
      These are my prayers for my beloved Mrs. Thrale; but these are not my only
      ones; no, the unfailing warmth of her kindness for myself I have rarely,
      for a long time past, slept without first petitioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran away without seeing you again when I found you repented that sweet
      compliance with my request which I had won from you. For the world would I
      not have pursued you, had I first seen your prohibition, nor could I
      endure to owe that consent to teasing which I only solicited from
      tenderness. Still, however, I think you had better have suffered me to
      follow you; I might have been of some use; I hardly could have been in
      your way. But I grieve now to have forced you to an interview which I
      would have spared myself as well as you, had I foreseen how little it
      would have answered my purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet though I cannot help feeling disappointed, I am not surprised; for in
      any case at all similar, I am sure I should have the same eagerness for
      solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you nothing of how sincerely I sympathise in your affliction; yet I
      believe that Mr. Crutchley and Dr. Johnson alone do so more earnestly; and
      I have some melancholy comfort in flattering myself that, allowing for the
      difference of our characters, that true regard which I felt was as truly
      returned. Nothing but kindness did I ever meet with; he ever loved to have
      me, not merely with his family, but with himself; and gratefully shall I
      ever remember a thousand kind expressions of esteem and good opinion,
      which are now crowding upon my memory.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY EXTENDS THE CIRCLE OF HER ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [During the years 1781 and 1782 Fanny was engaged upon her
     second novel, &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; which was published in July, 1782.
     It is not necessary here to discuss the merits of a work
     with which everyone ought to be acquainted.  We may safely
     leave the task of criticising &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; to an unimpeachable
     authority, Edmund Burke, whose magnificent, but just eulogy
     of the book will be found on page 232 Of the present volume.
     In the following section of &ldquo;The Diary&rdquo; Fanny records one
     of the most memorable events of her life,&mdash;her introduction
     to Burke, in June, 1782, at Sir Joshua Reynolds's house on
     Richmond Hill.  Her letter to Mr. Crisp, printed in the
     &ldquo;Memoirs of Dr. Burney,&rdquo; gives a more detailed account than
     that in the &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; of the conversation which passed on
     this occasion.  Other men of genius were present, among them
     Gibbon the historian, whom she then met for the first time;
     but Fanny had eyes and ears for none but Burke.  Nor was she
     singular in yielding thus completely to the fascination of
     the great Irishman's manner and conversation.  Wherever he
     appeared, in what society soever he mingled, Burke was still
     the man of distinction.  As Johnson said, you could not
     stand under a shed with Burke for a few minutes, during a
     shower of rain, without feeling that you were in the company
     of an extraordinary man.

     Mr. Thrale's death produced no immediate change in the
     situation of affairs at Streatham.  Dr. Johnson's visits
     were as frequent and as protracted as before; Fanny
     continued to be numbered among the dearest friends of the
     widow.  Not yet had arisen that infatuation which eventually
     alienated from Mrs. Thrale the sympathy of her former
     friends, and subjected her, justly or unjustly, to such
     severe and general condemnation.  But to this topic we shall
     revert at a later period.

     The great brewer had left his wife and family in affluent
     circumstances.  The executors to his Will were Dr. Johnson,
     Mr. Henry Smith, Mr. Cator and Mr. Crutchley, together with
     Mrs. Thrale.  Of the last-named gentleman we shall hear a
     good deal in the following pages.  He and Mr. Cator were
     both chosen members of parliament In the same year&mdash;1784:
     Mr. Cator for Ipswich, Mr. Crutchley for Horsham.  Early in
     the summer following Thrale's decease the brewery was sold
     for the handsome sum of 135,000 pounds, to David Barclay,
     the Quaker, who took Thrale's old manager, Perkins into
     Partnership.  Thus was founded the famous house Of Barclay
     and Perkins.-ED-]

    <h2>
      YOUNG MR. CRUTCHLEY RUFFLES MISS BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Streatham, May.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Miss Owen and I arrived here without incident, which, in a journey of six
      or seven miles, was really marvellous. Mrs. Thrale came from the Borough
      with two of the executors, Dr. Johnson and Mr Crutchley soon after us. She
      had been sadly worried, and in the evening frightened us all by again
      fainting away. Dear creature! she is all agitation of mind and of body:
      but she is now wonderfully recovered though in continual fevers about her
      affairs, which are mighty difficult and complicate indeed. Yet the
      behaviour of all the executors is exactly to her wish. Mr. Crutchley, in
      particular, was he a darling son or only brother could not possibly be
      more truly devoted to her. Indeed., I am very happy in the revolution in
      my own mind in favour of this young man, whom formerly I so little liked;
      for I now see so much of him, business and inclination uniting to bring
      him hither continually, that if he were disagreeable to me, I should spend
      my time in a most comfortless manner. On the contrary, I both respect and
      esteem him very highly; for his whole conduct manifests so much goodness
      of heart and excellence of principle, that he is Un homme comme ill y en a
      peu; and that first appearance of coldness, pride, reserve, and sneering,
      all wears off upon further acquaintance, and leaves behind nothing but
      good-humour and good-will. And this you must allow to be very candid, when
      I tell you that, but yesterday, he affronted me so much by a piece Of
      impertinence that I had a very serious quarrel with im.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday morning nobody went to church but Mr. Crutchley, Miss Thrale, and
      myself; and some time after, when I was sauntering upon the lawn before
      the house, Mr. Crutchley joined me. We were returning together into the
      house, when, Mrs. Thrale, popping her head out of her dressing-room
      window, called out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nicely these men domesticate among us, Miss Burney! Why, they take to
      us as natural as life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; cried Mr. Crutchley, &ldquo;I have sent for my horse, and I shall
      release you early to-morrow morning, I think yonder comes Sir Philip."<a
      href="#linknote-136" name="linknoteref-136" id="linknoteref-136">[136]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you'll have enough to do with him,&rdquo; cried she, laughing; &ldquo;he is well
      prepared to plague you, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&mdash;and what about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, about Miss Burney. He asked me the other day what was my present
      establishment. 'Mr. Crutchley and Miss Burney,' I answered. 'How well
      those two names go together,' cried he; 'I think they can't do better than
      make a match of it: I will consent, I am sure,' he added; and to-day, I
      dare say, you will hear enough of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I leave you to judge if I was pleased at this stuff thus communicated; but
      Mrs. Thrale, with all her excellence, can give up no occasion of making
      sport, however unseasonable, or even painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to him, indeed,&rdquo; cried I, dryly; and Mr. Crutchley
      called out, &ldquo;Thank him!&mdash;thank him!&rdquo; in a voice of pride and of pique
      that spoke him mortally angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I instantly came into the house, leaving him to talk it out with Mrs.
      Thrale, to whom I heard him add, &ldquo;So this is Sir Philip's kindness!&rdquo; and
      her answer, &ldquo;I wish you no worse luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, what think you of this? was it not highly insolent?&mdash;and from a
      man who has behaved to me hitherto with the utmost deference, good-nature,
      and civility, and given me a thousand reasons, by every possible
      opportunity, to think myself very high indeed in his good opinion and good
      graces? But these rich men think themselves the constant prey of all
      portionless girls, and are always upon their guard, and suspicious of some
      design to take them in. This sort of disposition I had very early observed
      in Mr. Crutchley, and therefore I had been more distant and cold with him
      than with anybody I ever met with; but latterly his character had risen so
      much in my mind, and his behaviour was so much improved, that I had let
      things take their own course, and no more shunned than I sought him; for I
      evidently saw his doubts concerning me and my plots were all at an end,
      and his civility and attentions were daily increasing, so that I had
      become very comfortable with him, and well pleased with his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not, I think, add that I determined to see as little of this most
      fearful and haughty gentleman in future as was in my power, since no good
      qualities can compensate for such arrogance of suspicion; and, therefore,
      as I had reason enough to suppose he would, in haste, resume his own
      reserve, I resolved, without much effort, to be beforehand with him in
      resuming mine.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY SULKS ON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At dinner we had a large and most disagreeable party of Irish ladies, whom
      Mrs. Thrale was necessitated to invite from motives of business and
      various connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to be seated between Miss O'Riley and Mr. Crutchley, to whom
      you may believe I was not very courteous, especially as I had some
      apprehension of Sir Philip. Mr. Crutchley, however, to my great surprise,
      was quite as civil as ever, and endeavoured to be as chatty; but there I
      begged to be excused, only answering upon the reply, and that very dryly,
      for I was indeed horribly provoked with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much diverted during dinner by this Miss O'Riley, who took it in her
      humour to attack Mr. Crutchley repeatedly, though so discouraging a beau
      never did I see! Her forwardness, and his excessive and inordinate
      coldness, made a contrast that, added to her brogue, which was broad, kept
      me in a grin irrepressible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon we had also Mr. Wallace, the attorney general, a most
      squat and squab looking man. In the evening, when the Irish ladies, the
      Perkinses, Lambarts, and Sir Philip, had gone, Mrs. Thrale walked out with
      Mr. Wallace, whom she had some business to talk over with; and then, when
      only Miss Owen, Miss T., and I remained, Mr. Crutchley, after repeatedly
      addressing me, and gaining pretty dry answers, called out suddenly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Burney! why, what's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, are you stricken, or smitten, or ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of the three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, you are setting down all these Irish folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; I don't think them worth the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I am sure you are; only I interrupted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went on no further with the argument, and Miss Thrale proposed our
      walking out to meet her mother. We all agreed and Mr. Crutchley would not
      be satisfied without walking near me, though I really had no patience to
      talk with him, and wished him at Jericho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;have you had a quarrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you affronted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word. Then again he called to Miss Thrale&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Queeny&mdash;why, she's quite in a rage! What have you done to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I still sulked on, vexed to be teased; but, though with a gaiety that
      showed he had no suspicion of the cause, he grew more and more urgent,
      trying every means to make me tell him what was the matter, till at last,
      much provoked, I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be strangely in want of a confidant, indeed, to take you for one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what an insolent speech!&rdquo; cried he, half serious and half laughing,
      but casting up his eyes and hands with astonishment. He then let me be
      quiet some time,&mdash;but in a few minutes renewed his inquiries, with
      added eagerness, begging me to tell him if nobody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      A likely matter! thought I; nor did I scruple to tell him, when forced to
      answer, that no one had such little chance of success in such a request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;for I am the best person in the world to trust with a
      secret, as I always forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued working at me till we joined Mrs. Thrale and the
      attorney-general. And then Miss Thrale, stimulated by him, came to inquire
      if I had really taken anything amiss of her. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it of me, then?&rdquo; cried Mr. Crutchley, as if sure I should say no; but
      I made no other answer than to desire him to desist questioning me....
    </p>
    <p>
      He then grew quite violent, and at last went on with his questions till,
      by being quite silent, he could no longer doubt who it was. He seemed then
      wholly amazed, and entreated to know what he had done; but I tried only to
      avoid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the attorney-general took his leave, during which ceremony Mr.
      Crutchley, coming behind me, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'd think of this creature's having any venom in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered I, &ldquo;when she's provoked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have I provoked you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I got off. Taking Miss Thrale by the arm, we hurried away, leaving
      him with Mrs. Thrale and Miss Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was presently, however, with us again; and when he came to my side and
      found me really trying to talk of other matters with Miss Thrale, and
      avoid him, he called out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my life, this is too bad! Do tell me, Miss Burney, what is the
      matter? If you won't, I protest I'll call Mrs. Thrale, and make her work
      at you herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; answered I, &ldquo;that it will be to no purpose for I must
      offend myself by telling it, and therefore I shall mention it to nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in the world have I done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; you have done nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I said, then? Only let me beg your pardon, only let me know
      what it is, that I may beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then took up the teasing myself, and quite insisted upon his leaving us,
      and joining Mrs. Thrale. He begged me to tell Miss Thrale, and let her
      mediate, and entreated her to be his agent; which, in order to get rid of
      him, she promised; and he then slackened his pace, though very
      reluctantly, while we quickened ours. He was, however, which I very little
      expected, too uneasy to stay long away; and when we had walked on quite
      out of hearing of Mrs. Thrale and Miss Owen, he suddenly galloped after
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How odd it is of you,&rdquo; said Miss Thrale, &ldquo;to come and intrude yourself in
      this manner upon anybody that tries so to avoid you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done anything for me?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I don't believe you have said
      a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, truly!&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;if I can keep my own self, out of scrapes,
      it's all I can pretend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but do tell me, Miss Burney,&mdash;pray tell me! indeed, this is
      quite too bad; I sha'n't have a wink of sleep all night! If I have
      offended you, I am very sorry indeed; but I am sure I did not mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; interrupted I, &ldquo;I don't suppose you did mean to offend me, nor
      do I know why you should. I expect from you neither good nor ill,&mdash;civility
      I think myself entitled to, and that is all I have any desire for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Tell me, however, but what it is, and if I
      have said any thing unguardedly, I am extremely sorry, and I most
      sincerely beg your pardon. If you would tell me, I am sure I could explain
      it off, because I am sure it has been done undesignedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it does not admit of any explanation; so pray don't mention it any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only tell me what part of the day it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether this unconsciousness was real, or only to draw me in so that he
      might come to the point, and make his apology with greater ease, I know
      not; but I assured him it was in vain he asked, and again desired him to
      puzzle himself with no further recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;but I shall think of every thing I have ever said to you
      for this half year. I am sure, whatever it was, it must have been unmeant
      and unguarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Sir, I never doubted; and probably you thought me hard enough to
      hear any thing without minding it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, Miss Burney! why, there is nobody I would not sooner offend,&mdash;nobody
      in the world! Queeny knows it. If Queeny would speak, she could tell you
      so. Is it not true, Miss Thrale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall say nothing about it; if I can keep my own neck out of the
      collar, it's enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But won't it plead something for me that you are sure, and must be sure,
      it was by blunder, and not design?... I beg you will think no more of it.
      I&mdash;I believe I know what it is; and, indeed, I was far from meaning
      to give you the smallest offence, and I most earnestly beg your pardon.
      There is nothing I would not do to assure you how sorry I am. But I hope
      it will be all over by the time the candles come. I shall look to see, and
      I hope&mdash;I beg&mdash;you will have the same countenance again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I now felt really appeased, and so I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then talked of other matters till we reached home, though it was not
      without difficulty I could even yet keep him quiet. I see that Mr.
      Crutchley, though of a cold and proud disposition, is generous, amiable,
      and delicate, and, when not touched upon the tender string of gallantry,
      concerning which he piques himself upon invariable hardness and
      immoveability, his sentiments are not merely just, but refined.

    <h2>
      TOO MUCH OF MANY THINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;We had Mr. and Mrs. Davenant here. They are very
      lively and agreeable, and I like them more' and more. Mrs. Davenant is one
      of the saucy women of the ton, indeed; but she has good parts, and is gay
      and entertaining; and her sposo, who passionately adores her, though five
      years her junior, is one of the best-tempered and most
      pleasant-charactered young men imaginable....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Davenant is very agreeable,&rdquo; said I to Mr. Crutchley, &ldquo;I like her
      much. Don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very much,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;she is lively and entertaining;&rdquo; and then a
      moment after, &ldquo;'Tis wonderful,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;that such a thing as that
      can captivate a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;nobody more, for her husband quite adores her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I find,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and Mrs. Thrale says men in general like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They certainly do,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;and all the oddity is in you who do not,
      not in them who do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;but it don't do for me, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We then came to two gates, and there I stopped short, to wait till they
      joined us; and Mr. Crutchley, turning about and looking at Mrs. Davenant,
      as she came forward, said, rather in a muttering voice, and to himself
      than to me, &ldquo;What a thing for an attachment! No, no, it would not do for
      me!&mdash;too much glare! too much flippancy! too much hoop! too much
      gauze! too much slipper! too much neck! Oh, hide it! hide it! muffle it
      up! muffle it up! If it is but in a fur cloak, I am for muffling it all
      up!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A &ldquo;POOR WRETCH OF A PAINTER.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      I had new specimens to-day of the oddities of Mr. Crutchley, whom I do not
      yet quite understand, though I have seen so much of him. In the course of
      our walks to-day we chanced, at one time, to be somewhat before the rest
      of the company, and soon got into a very serious conversation; though we
      began it by his relating a most ludicrous incident which had happened to
      him last winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain poor wretch of a villainous painter, one Mr. Lowe,<a
      href="#linknote-137" name="linknoteref-137" id="linknoteref-137">[137]</a>
      who is in some measure under Dr. Johnson's protection, and whom,
      therefore, he recommends to all the people he thinks can afford to sit for
      their pictures. Among these he made Mr. Seward very readily, and then
      applied to Mr. Crutchley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said Mr. Crutchley, as he told me the circumstance, &ldquo;I have not
      a notion of sitting for my picture,&mdash;for who wants it? I may as well
      give the man the money without; but no, they all said that would not do so
      well, and Dr. Johnson asked me to give him my picture. 'And I assure you,
      sir,' says he, 'I shall put it in very good company, for I have portraits
      of some very respectable people in my dining-room.' 'Ay, sir,' says I,
      'that's sufficient reason why you should not have mine, for I am sure it
      has no business in such society.' So then Mrs. Thrale asked me to give it
      to her. 'Ay sure, ma'am,' says I, 'you do me great honour; but pray,
      first, will you do me the favour to tell me what door you intend to put it
      behind?' However, after all I could say in opposition, I was obliged to go
      to the painter's. And I found him in such a condition! a room all dirt and
      filth, brats squalling and wrangling, up two pair of stairs, and a closet,
      of which the door was open, that Seward well said was quite Pandora's box&mdash;it
      was the repository of all the nastiness, and stench, and filth, and food,
      and drink, and&mdash;-oh, it was too bad to be borne! and 'Oh!' says I,
      'Mr. Lowe, I beg your pardon for running away, but I have just recollected
      another engagement;' so I poked the three guineas in his hand, and told
      him I would come again another time, and then ran out of the house with
      all my might.&rdquo;

      DR. JOHNSON IN A RAGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>June.&mdash;Wednesday</i>&mdash;We had a terrible noisy day. Mr. and
      Mrs. Cator came to dinner, and brought with them Miss Collison, a niece.
      Mrs. Nesbitt was also here, and Mr. Pepys.<a href="#linknote-138"
       name="linknoteref-138" id="linknoteref-138">[138]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The long war which has been proclaimed among the wits concerning Lord
      Lyttelton's &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; by Dr. Johnson, and which a whole tribe of &ldquo;blues,&rdquo;
       with Mrs. Montagu at their head, have vowed to execrate and revenge, now
      broke out with all the fury of the first actual hostilities, stimulated by
      long concerted schemes and much spiteful information. Mr. Pepys, Dr.
      Johnson well knew, was one of Mrs. Montagu's steadiest abettors; and,
      therefore, as he had some time determined to defend himself with the first
      of them he met, this day he fell the sacrifice to his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a long tete-a-tete which I accidentally had with Mr. Pepys before the
      company was assembled, he told me his apprehensions of an attack, and
      entreated me earnestly to endeavour to prevent it; modestly avowing he was
      no antagonist for Dr. Johnson; and yet declaring his personal friendship
      for Lord Lyttelton made him so much hurt by the &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; that he feared he
      could not discuss the matter without a quarrel, which, especially in the
      house of Mrs. Thrale, he wished to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, utterly impossible for me to serve him. I could have
      stopped Mrs. Thrale with ease, and Mr. Seward with a hint, had either of
      them begun the subject; but, unfortunately, in the middle of dinner, it
      was begun by Dr. Johnson himself, to oppose whom, especially as he spoke
      with great anger, would have been madness and folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before have I seen Dr. Johnson speak with so much passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pepys,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice the most enraged, &ldquo;I understand you are
      offended by my 'Life of Lord Lyttelton.' What is it you have to say
      against it? Come forth, man here am I, ready to answer any charge you can
      bring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Pepys, &ldquo;not at present; I must beg leave to decline
      the subject. I told Miss Burney before dinner that I hoped it would not be
      started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was quite frightened to hear my own name mentioned in a debate which
      began so seriously; but Dr. Johnson made not&mdash;to this any answer, he
      repeated his attack and his challenge, and a violent disputation ensued,
      in which this great but mortal man did, to own the truth, appear
      unreasonably furious and grossly severe. I never saw him so before, and I
      heartily hope I never shall again. He has been long provoked, and justly
      enough, at the sneaking complaints and murmurs of the Lytteltonians; and,
      therefore, his long-excited wrath, which hitherto had met no object, now
      burst forth with a vehemence and bitterness almost incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepys meantime never appeared to so much advantage; he preserved his
      temper, uttered all that belonged merely to himself with modesty, and all
      that more immediately related to Lord Lyttelton with spirit. Indeed, Dr.
      Johnson, in the very midst of the dispute, had the candour and liberality
      to make him a personal compliment, by saying
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, all that you say, while you are vindicating one who cannot thank
      you, makes me only think better of you than I ever did before. Yet still I
      think you do me wrong,&rdquo; etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, in the heat of the argument, he called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more my Lord Lyttelton is inquired after, the worse he will appear;
      Mr. Seward has just heard two stories of him, which corroborate all I have
      related.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then desired Mr. Seward to repeat them. Poor Mr. Seward looked almost
      as frightened as myself at the very mention of his name; but he quietly
      and immediately told the stories, which consisted of fresh instances, from
      good authorities, of Lord Lyttelton's illiberal behaviour to Shenstone;
      and then he flung himself back in his chair, and spoke no more during the
      whole debate, which I am sure he was ready to vote a bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      One happy circumstance, however, attended the quarrel, which was the
      presence of Mr. Cator, who would by no means be prevented talking himself,
      either by reverence for Dr. Johnson, or ignorance of the subject in
      question; on the contrary, he gave his opinion, quite uncalled upon every
      thing that was said by either party, and that with an importance and
      pomposity, yet with an emptiness and verbosity, that rendered the whole
      dispute, when in his hands, nothing more than ridiculous, and compelled
      even the disputants themselves, all inflamed as they were, to laugh. To
      give a specimen&mdash;one speech will do for a thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to this here question of Lord Lyttelton, I can't speak to it to the
      purpose, as I have not read his 'Life,' for I have only read the 'Life of
      Pope;' I have got the books though, for I sent for them last week, and
      they came to me on Wednesday, and then I began them; but I have not yet
      read 'Lord Lyttelton.' 'Pope' I have begun, and that is what I am now
      reading. But what I have to say about Lord Lyttelton is this here: Mr.
      Seward says that Lord Lyttelton's steward dunned Mr. Shenstone for his
      rent, by which I understand he was a tenant of Lord Lyttelton's. Well, if
      he was a tenant of Lord Lyttelton's, why should not he pay his rent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who could contradict this?
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was quite over, and we left the men to their wine, we hoped
      they would finish the affair; but Dr. Johnson was determined to talk it
      through, and make a battle of it, though Mr. Pepys tried to be off
      continually. When they were all summoned to tea, they entered still warm
      and violent. Mr. Cator had the book in his hand, and was reading the &ldquo;Life
      of Lyttelton,&rdquo; that he might better, he said, understand the cause, though
      not a creature cared if he had never heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepys came up to me and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I had so much wished to avoid! I have been crushed in the very
      onset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could make him no answer, for Dr. Johnson immediately called him off,
      and harangued and attacked him with a vehemence and continuity that quite
      concerned both Mrs. Thrale and myself, and that made Mr. Pepys, at last,
      resolutely silent, however called upon. This now grew more unpleasant than
      ever; till Mr. Cator, having some time studied his book, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I am now going to say, as I have not yet read the 'Life of Lord
      Lyttelton' quite through, must be considered as being only said aside,
      because what I am going to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, sir,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;it had been all said aside; here is too
      much about it, indeed, and I should be very glad to hear no more of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, which she made with great spirit and dignity, had an
      admirable effect. Everybody was silenced. Mr. Cator, thus interrupted in
      the midst of his proposition, looked quite amazed; Mr. Pepys was much
      gratified by the interference; and Dr. Johnson, after a pause, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madam, you shall hear no more of it; yet I will defend myself in
      every part and in every atom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And from this time the subject was wholly dropped. This dear violent
      doctor was conscious he had been wrong, and therefore he most candidly
      bore the reproof....
    </p>
    <p>
      When the leave-taking time arrived, Dr. Johnson called to Mr. Pepys to
      shake hands, an invitation which was most coldly and forcibly accepted.<a

    <h2>
      THE MISERABLE HOST AND MELANCHOLY GUEST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, June 17.</i>&mdash;There passed, some time ago, an 'agreement'
      between Mr. Crutchley and Mr. Seward, that the latter is to make a visit
      to the former, at his country house in Berkshire; and to-day the time was
      settled; but a more ridiculous scene never was exhibited. The host elect
      and the guest elect tried which should show least expectation of pleasure
      from the meeting, and neither of them thought it at all worth while to
      disguise his terror of being weary of the other. Mr. Seward seemed quite
      melancholy and depressed in the prospect of making, and Mr. Crutchley
      absolutely miserable in that of receiving, the visit. Yet nothing so
      ludicrous as the distress of both, since nothing less necessary than that
      either should have such a punishment inflicted. I cannot remember half the
      absurd things that passed&mdash;but a few, by way of specimen, I will
      give.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you intend to stay with me, Seward?&rdquo; cried Mr. Crutchley;
      &ldquo;how long do you think you can bear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don't know; I sha'n't fix,&rdquo; answered the other: &ldquo;just as I find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;when shall you come? Friday or Saturday? I think you'd
      better not come till Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I believe on Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Friday! Oh, you'll have too much of it! what shall I do with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, on Sunday we'll dine at the Lyells'. Mrs. Lyell is a charming woman;
      one of the most elegant creatures I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderfully so,&rdquo; cried Mr. Crutchley; &ldquo;I like her extremely&mdash;an
      insipid idiot! She never opens her mouth but in a whisper; I never heard
      her speak a word in my life. But what must I do with you on Monday? will
      you come away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I'll stay and see it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how long shall you stay? Why, I must come away myself on Tuesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I sha'n't settle yet,&rdquo; cried Mr. Seward, very dryly. &ldquo;I shall put up
      six shirts, and then do as I find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six shirts!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Crutchley '; and then, with equal dryness,
      added&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, I suppose you wear two a-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so on....
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>June 26.</i>&mdash;Mr. Crutchley said he had just brought Mr. Seward to
      town in his phaeton, alive. He gave a diverting account of the visit,
      which I fancy proved much better than either party pretended to expect, as
      I find Mr. Seward not only went a day sooner, but stayed two days later,
      than was proposed; and Mr. Crutchley, on his part, said he had invited him
      to repeat his visit at any time when he knew not in what other manner &ldquo;to
      knock down a day or two. When he was at my place,&rdquo; continued Mr.
      Crutchley, &ldquo;he did himself up pretty handsomely; he ate cherries till he
      complained most bitterly of indigestion, and he poured down madeira and
      port most plentifully, but without relief. Then he desired to have some
      peppermint-water, and he drank three glasses; still that would not do, and
      he said he must have a large quantity of ginger. We had no such thing in
      the house. However, he had brought some, it seems, with him, and then he
      took that, but still to no purpose. At last, he desired some brandy, and
      tossed off a glass of that; and, after all, he asked for a dose of
      rhubarb. Then we had to send and inquire all over the house for this
      rhubarb, but our folks had hardly ever heard of such a thing. I advised
      him to take a good bumper of gin and gunpowder, for that seemed almost all
      he had left untried.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      TWO CELEBRATED DUCHESSES DISCUSSED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday, June 26</i>.&mdash;Dr. Johnson, who had been in town some
      days, returned, and Mr. Crutchley came also, as well as my father. I did
      not see the two latter till summoned to dinner; and then Dr. Johnson
      seizing my hand, while with one of his own he gave me a no very gentle tap
      on the shoulder, half drolly and half reproachfully called out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you little baggage, you! and have you known how long I have been
      here, and never to come to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the truth is, in whatever sportive mood he expresses it, he really
      likes not I should be absent from him half a minute whenever he is here,
      and not in his own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson, as usual, kept me in chat with him in the library after all
      the rest had dispersed; but when Mr. Crutchley returned again, he went
      upstairs, and, as I was finishing some work I had in hand, Mr. Crutchley,
      either from civility or a sudden turn to loquacity, forbore his books, to
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other folks, we discussed the two rival duchesses, Rutland and
      Devonshire.<a href="#linknote-140" name="linknoteref-140"
       id="linknoteref-140">[140]</a> &ldquo;The former,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;must, he fancied,
      be very weak and silly, as he knew that she endured being admired to her
      face, and complimented perpetually, both upon her beauty and her dress;&rdquo;
       and when I asked whether he was one who joined in trying her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;no, indeed! I never complimented any body; that is, I
      never said to any body a thing I did not think, unless I was openly
      laughing at them, and making sport for other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;if everybody went by this rule, what a world of
      conversation would be curtailed! The Duchess of Devonshire, I fancy, has
      better parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; and a fine, pleasant, open countenance. She came to my sister's
      once, in Lincolnshire, when I was there, in order to see hare-hunting,
      which was then quite new to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very amiable, I believe,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for all her friends love and
      speak highly of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, very much so&mdash;perfectly good-humoured and unaffected. And
      her horse was led, and she was frightened; and we told her that was the
      hare, and that was the dog; and the dog pointed to the hare, and the hare
      ran away from the dog and then she took courage, and then she was timid;&mdash;and,
      upon my word, she did it all very prettily! For my part, I liked it so
      well, that in half an hour I took to my own horse, and rode away.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MR. CRUTCHLEY IS BANTERED ABOUT HIS PRIDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While we were at church on Sunday morning, we heard a sermon, upon which,
      by means of a speech I chanced to make, we have been talking ever since.
      The subject was treating of humility, and declaiming against pride; in the
      midst of which Mrs. Thrale whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sermon is all against us; that is, four of us: Queeny, Burney,
      Susan, and I, are all as proud as possible&mdash;Mr. Crutchley and Sophy<a
      href="#linknote-141" name="linknoteref-141" id="linknoteref-141">[141]</a>
      are humble enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;Mr. Crutchley!&mdash;why he is the proudest
      among us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech she instantly repeated, and just at that moment the preacher
      said&mdash;&ldquo;Those&mdash;who are the weakest are ever the soonest puffed
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He instantly made me a bow, with an expressive laugh, that thanked me for
      the compliment. To be sure it happened most untimely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we came out of church, he called out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Burney, this is what I never can forgive! Am I so proud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure if you are,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;you have imposed upon me, for
      I always thought you the humblest man I knew. Look how Burney casts up her
      eyes! Why, are you so proud, after all, Mr. Crutchley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; cried he, rather gravely &ldquo;but I little thought of ever going
      to Streatham church to hear I was the proudest man in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;does it follow you certainly are so because I say
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, I suppose I am if you see it, for you are one that see all
      things and people right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's very odd,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;I wonder how she found you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; cried I, laughing, &ldquo;how you missed finding him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! worse and worse!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Why there's no bearing this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;he has always taken me in; he seemed
      to me the humblest creature I knew; always speaking so ill of himself&mdash;always
      depreciating all that belongs to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I did not say,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;that he had more vanity than other men; on
      the contrary, I think he has none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well distinguished,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;a man may be proud enough, and yet have
      no vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what is this pride?&rdquo; cried Mr. Crutchley; &ldquo;what is it shown in?&mdash;what
      are its symptoms and marks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A general contempt,&rdquo; answered I, undaunted, &ldquo;of every body and of every
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, Miss Burney!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Thrale. &ldquo;Why that's true enough,
      and so he has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A total indifference,&rdquo; continued I, &ldquo;of what is thought of him by others,
      and a disdain alike of happiness or misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Burney!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;that's true enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried Mr. Crutchley, &ldquo;you are quite mistaken. Indeed, nobody in
      the world is half so anxious about the opinions of others; I am wretched&mdash;I
      am miserable if I think myself thought ill of; not, indeed, by everybody,
      but by those whose good opinion I have tried&mdash;there if I fall, no man
      can be more unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perhaps,&rdquo; returned I, &ldquo;there may be two or three people in the world
      you may wish should think well of you, but that is nothing to the general
      character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! many more. I am now four-and-thirty, and perhaps, indeed, in all
      my life I have not tried to gain the esteem of more than four-and-thirty
      people, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave out the thirty!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;and then you may be nearer the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed: ten, at least, I daresay I have tried for, but, perhaps, I
      have not succeeded with two. However, I am thus even with the world; for
      if it likes me not, I can do without it&mdash;I can live alone; and that,
      indeed, I prefer to any thing I can meet with; for those with whom I like
      to live are so much above me, that I sink into nothing in their society;
      so I think it best to run away from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;you are angry you cannot yourself excel&mdash;and
      this is not pride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, indeed; but it is melancholy to be always behind&mdash;to hear
      conversation in which one is unable to join&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unwilling,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, but really unable; and therefore what can I do so well as to
      run home? As to an inferior, I hope I think that of nobody; and as to my
      equals, and such as I am on a par with, heaven knows I can ill bear them!&mdash;I
      would rather live alone to all eternity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation lasted till we got home, when Mrs. Thrale said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Crutchley, has she convinced you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;but he has convinced me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how you smote him,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;but I think you make your
      part good as you go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great difference,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which I think there is between Mr. Seward
      and Mr. Crutchley, who in some things are very much alike, is this&mdash;Mr.
      Seward has a great deal of vanity and no pride, Mr. Crutchley a great deal
      of pride and no vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just, and true, and wise!&rdquo; said dear Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;for Seward is always
      talking of himself, and always with approbation; Mr. Crutchley seldom
      mentions himself, and when he does, it is with dislike. And which have I,
      most pride or most vanity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, most vanity, certa!&rdquo; quoth I.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Supper we had only Sir Philip and Mr. Crutchley. The conversation of
      the morning was then again renewed.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;what a smoking did Miss Burney give Mr.
      Crutchley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A smoking, indeed!&rdquo; cried He. &ldquo;Never had I such a one before! Never did I
      think to get such a character! I had no notion of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why should you, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is all this?&rdquo; cried Sir Philip, delighted enough at any mischief
      between Mr. Crutchley and me, or between any male and female, for he only
      wishes something to go forward, and thinks a quarrel or dispute next best
      to fondness and flirting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Burney,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;gave Mr. Crutchley this morning a noble
      trimming. I had always thought him very humble, but she shewed me my
      mistake, and said I had not distinguished pride from vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never was I so mauled in my life,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough, however, of this rattle, which lasted till we all went to bed, and
      which Mrs. Thrale most kindly kept up, by way of rioting me from thinking,
      and which Mr. Crutchley himself bore with the utmost good nature, from
      having noticed that I was out of spirits....
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>July 2</i>&mdash;The other morning Mrs. Thrale ran hastily into my
      room, her eyes full of tears, and cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary man is this Crutchley! I declare he has quite
      melted me! He came to me just now, and thinking I was uneasy I could do no
      more for Perkins,<a href="#linknote-142" name="linknoteref-142"
       id="linknoteref-142">[142]</a> though he cared not himself if the man were
      drowned, he offered to lend him a thousand pounds, merely by way of giving
      pleasure to me!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MISS SOPHY STREATHIELD IS COMMENTED ON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well-it was, I think, Saturday, Aug. 25, that Mrs Thrale brought me back.<a
      href="#linknote-143" name="linknoteref-143" id="linknoteref-143">[143]</a>
      We then took up Mr. Crutchley, who had come to his town-house upon
      business, and who accompanied us thither for a visit of three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Mr. Seward also came. He has been making the western tour,
      and gave us, with a seriousness that kept me continually grinning, some
      account of a doctor, apothecary, or 'chemist' belonging to every town at
      which he had stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when we all laughed at his thus following up the faculty, he
      undauntedly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it the best way to get information; I know no better method to
      learn what is going forward anywhere than to send for the chief physician
      of the place, so I commonly consult him the first day I stop at a place,
      and when I have fee'd him, and made acquaintance, he puts me in a way to
      find out what is worth looking at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A most curious mode of picking up a cicerone!
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, still pursuing his favourite topic, he began to inquire into
      the particulars of Mr. Crutchley's late illness&mdash;but that gentleman,
      who is as much in the opposite extreme, of disdaining even any decent care
      of himself, as Mr. Seward is in the other, of devoting almost all his
      thoughts to his health cut the matter very short, and would not talk upon
      it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if I had known sooner,&rdquo; said Mr. Seward, &ldquo;that you were ill, I
      should have come to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you?&rdquo; cried Mr. Crutchley, with a loud laugh; &ldquo;very kind, indeed!&mdash;it
      would have been charming to see you when I am ill, when I am afraid of
      undertaking you even when well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some time after Sophy Streatfield was talked of,&mdash;Oh, with how much
      impertinence as if she was at the service of any man who would make
      proposals to her! Yet Mr. Seward spoke of her with praise and tenderness
      all the time, as if, though firmly of this opinion, he was warmly her
      admirer. From such admirers and such admiration heaven guard me! Mr.
      Crutchley said but little; but that little was bitter enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Mr. Seward, &ldquo;after all that can be said, there is nobody
      whose manners are more engaging, nobody more amiable than the little
      Sophy; and she is certainly very pretty; I must own I have always been
      afraid to trust myself with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Crutchley looked very sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, squire,&rdquo; cried Mr. Seward, &ldquo;she is very dangerous, I can tell you;
      and if she had you at a fair trial, she would make an impression that
      would soften even your hard heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need of any further trial,&rdquo; answered he, laughing, &ldquo;for she has done
      that already; and so soft was the impression that it is absolutely all
      dissolved!&mdash;melted quite away, and not a trace of it left!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Seward then proposed that she should marry Sir John Miller,<a
      href="#linknote-144" name="linknoteref-144" id="linknoteref-144">[144]</a>
      who has just lost his wife and very gravely said, he had a great mind to
      set out for Tunbridge, and carry her with him to Bath, and so make the
      match without delay!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;if you fail, you will think yourself
      bound in honour to marry her yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's the thing,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no, I can't take the little Sophy
      myself; I should have too many rivals; no, that won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How abominably conceited and sure these pretty gentlemen are! However, Mr.
      Crutchley here made a speech that half won my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Miss Streatfield was here at this moment to cuff you,
      Seward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cuff me!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;What, the little Sophy!&mdash;and why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For disposing of her so freely. I think a man deserves to be cuffed for
      saying any lady will marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seconded this speech with much approbation.

    <h2>
      GARRULOUS MR. MUSGRAVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>August, Monday.</i>&mdash;We were to have Mr. Cator and other company
      to dinner; and all breakfast Mr. Seward kept plaguing poor Mr. Musgrave,
      who is an incessant talker, about the difficulty he would have in making
      his part good with Mr. Cator, who, he assured him, would out-talk him if
      he did not take care. And Mr. Crutchley recommended to him to &ldquo;wait for a
      sneeze,&rdquo; in order to put in; so that he was almost rallied into a passion,
      though, being very good-natured, he made light of it, and it blew over.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of dinner I was seized with a violent laughing fit, by
      seeing Mr. Musgrave, who had sat quite silent, turn very solemnly to Mr.
      Seward and say in a reproachful tone,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seward, you said I should be fighting to talk all the talk, and here I
      have not spoke once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Seward, nodding at him, &ldquo;why don't you put in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I lost an opportunity just now, when Mr. Cator&mdash;talked of
      climates; I had something I could have said about them very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, however, he made himself amends; for when we left the men to
      their wine, he began such a violent dispute with Mr Cator, that Mr.
      Jenkinson and Mr. Crutchley left the field of battle, and went out to join
      the ladies in their walk round the grounds; and that breaking up the
      party, the rest soon followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, I happened not to walk myself, which was most ludicrously
      noticed by Mr. Musgrave; who, while we were at tea, suddenly crossed the
      circle to come up to me, and say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not walk, Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much in the right&mdash;very much in the right, indeed! You were
      studying? Oh, very right! never lose a moment! Such an understanding as
      yours it would be a shame to neglect; it ought to be cultivated every
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he hurried back to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when all the company was gone but our three gentlemen,
      Seward, Crutchley, and Musgrave, we took a walk round the grounds by
      moonlight&mdash;and Mr. Musgrave started with rapture at the appearance of
      the moon, now full, now cloudy, now clear, now obscured, every three yards
      we moved.

    <h2>
      A PARTING SHOT AT MR. CRUTCHLEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, Sept. 11</i>.&mdash;And now, if I am not mistaken, I come to
      relate the conclusion of Mr. Crutchley's most extraordinary summer career
      at Streatham, which place, I believe, he has now left without much
      intention to frequently revisit. However, this is mere conjecture; but he
      really had a run of ill-luck not very inviting to a man of his cold and
      splenetic turn to play the same game.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were just going to supper, we heard a disturbance among the dogs;
      and Mrs. and Miss Thrale went out to see what was the matter, while Dr.
      Johnson and I remained quiet. Soon returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend! a friend!&rdquo; she cried, and was followed by Mr. Crutchley. He
      would not eat with us, but was chatty and in good-humour, and as usual,
      when in spirits, saucily sarcastic. For instance, it is generally half my
      employment in hot evenings here to rescue some or other poor buzzing idiot
      of an insect from the flame of a candle. This, accordingly, I was
      performing with a Harry Longlegs, which, after much trial to catch, eluded
      me, and escaped, nobody could see how. Mr. Crutchley vowed I had caught
      and squeezed him to death in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;when I catch them, I put them out of the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, their bodies,&rdquo; said he, laughing; &ldquo;but their legs, I suppose, you
      keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, indeed; I hold them very safe in the palm of my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the palm of your hand! why, it would not hold a fly! But
      what have you done with the poor wretch! thrown him under the table
      slily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, help to establish your full character for mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now was not that a speech to provoke Miss Grizzle herself? However, I only
      made up a saucy lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried he, offering to take my hand, &ldquo;where is he? Which hand is he
      in? Let me examine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I thank you; I sha'n't make you my confessor, whenever I take
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not much like this; but I did not mean he should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he told us a most unaccountably ridiculous story of a crying
      wife. A gentleman, he said, of his acquaintance had married lately his own
      kept mistress; and last Sunday he had dined with the bride and bridegroom,
      but, to his utter astonishment, without any apparent reason in the world,
      in the middle of dinner or tea, she burst into a violent fit of crying,
      and went out of the room, though there was not the least quarrel, and the
      sposo seemed all fondness and attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then,&rdquo; said I, somewhat maliciously, I grant, &ldquo;had you been saying
      to er?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; said he, with a half-affronted bow, &ldquo;I expected this! I
      declare I thought you would conclude it was me!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      SISTER AUTHORESSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      (Fanny Burney to Mrs. Philips, late Miss Susan Burney.)
    </p>
    <p>
      February, 1782.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have a frank and a subject, I will leave my bothers, and write you
      and my dear brother Molesworth<a href="#linknote-145"
       name="linknoteref-145" id="linknoteref-145">[145]</a> a little account of
      a rout I have just been at, at the house of Mr. Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will wonder, perhaps, in this time of hurry, why I went thither; but
      when I tell you Pacchierotti<a href="#linknote-146" name="linknoteref-146"
       id="linknoteref-146">[146]</a> was there, you will not think it
      surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crowd of company; Charlotte and I went together; my father
      came afterwards. Mrs. Paradise received us very graciously, and led me
      immediately up to Miss Thrale, who was sitting by the Pac.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were very late, for we had waited cruelly for the coach, and Pac. had
      sung a song out of &ldquo;Artaxerxes,&rdquo; composed for a tenor, which we lost, to
      my infinite regret. Afterwards he sang &ldquo;Dolce speme&rdquo; delightfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Paradise, leaning over the Kirwans and Charlotte, who hardly got a
      seat all night for the crowd, said she begged to speak to me. I squeezed
      my great person out, and she then said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, Lady Say and Sele desires the honour of being introduced to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship stood by her side. She seems pretty near fifty-at least
      turned forty; her head was full of feathers, flowers, jewels, and
      gew-gaws, and as high as Lady Archer's her dress was trimmed with beads,
      silver, persian sashes, and all sorts of fine fancies; her face is thin
      and fiery, and her whole manner spoke a lady all alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried she, with great quickness, and a look all curiosity,
      &ldquo;I am very happy to see you; I have longed to see you a great while. I
      have read your performance, and I am quite delighted with it. I think it's
      the most elegant novel I ever read in my life. Such a style! I am quite
      surprised at it. I can't think where you got so much invention!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may believe this was a reception not to make me very loquacious. I did
      not know which way to turn my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must introduce you,&rdquo; continued her ladyship, &ldquo;to my sister; she'll be
      quite delighted to see you. She has written a novel herself so you are
      sister authoresses. A most elegant thing it is, I assure you; almost as
      pretty as yours, only not quite so elegant. She has written two novels,
      only one is not so pretty as the other. But I shall insist upon your
      seeing them. One is in letters, like yours, only yours is prettiest; it's
      called the 'Mausoleum of Julia'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What unfeeling things, thought I, are my sisters! I'm sure I never heard
      them go about thus praising me. Mrs. Paradise then again came forward, and
      taking my hand, led me up to her ladyship's sister, Lady Hawke, saying
      aloud, and with a courteous smirk,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, ma'am, authoress of 'Evelina.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried my friend, Lady Say and Sele, who followed me close, &ldquo;it's
      the authoress of 'Evelina,' so you are sister authoresses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hawke arose and curtsied. She is much younger than her sister, and
      rather pretty; extremely languishing, delicate, and pathetic; apparently
      accustomed to be reckoned the genius of her family, and well contented to
      be looked upon as a creature dropped from the clouds. I was then seated
      between their ladyships, and Lady S. and S., drawing as near to me as
      possible, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so you wrote this pretty book!&mdash;and pray did your papa
      know of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; not till some months after the publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I've heard&mdash;it's surprising! I can't think how you invented it!&mdash;there's
      a vast deal of invention in it! And you've got so much humour, too! Now my
      sister has no humour; hers is all sentiment. You can't think how I was
      entertained with that old grandmother and her son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose she meant Tom Branghton for the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much pleasure you must have had in writing it; had not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So has my sister; she's never without a pen in her hand; she can't help
      writing for her life. When Lord Hawke is travelling about with her, she
      keeps writing all the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Hawke; &ldquo;I really can't help writing. One has great
      pleasure in writing the things; has one not, Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your novel,&rdquo; cried Lady Say and Sele, &ldquo;is in such a style!&mdash;so
      elegant! I am vastly glad you made it end happily. I hate a novel that
      don't end happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Hawke, with a languid smile, &ldquo;I was vastly glad when she
      married Lord Orville. I was sadly afraid it would not have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister intends,&rdquo; said Lady Say and Sele, &ldquo;to print her 'Mausoleum,'
      just for her own friends and acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Hawke; &ldquo;I have never printed yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Lady Hawke's name,&rdquo; quoth I to my first friend, &ldquo;ascribed to the
      play of 'Variety.'&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-147" name="linknoteref-147"
       id="linknoteref-147">[147]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you indeed?&rdquo; cried Lady Say, in an ecstasy. &ldquo;Sister! do you know Miss
      Burney saw your name in the newspapers, about the play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; said Lady Hawke, smiling complacently. &ldquo;But I really did not
      write it; I never wrote a play in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Lady Say, &ldquo;but do repeat that sweet part that I am so fond
      of&mdash;you know what I mean; Miss Burney must hear it,&mdash;out of your
      novel, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady H.-No, I can't; I have forgot it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady S.-Oh, no! I am sure you have not; I insist upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady H.-But I know you can repeat it yourself; you have so fine a memory;
      I am sure you can repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady S.-Oh, but I should not do it justice! that's all,&mdash;I should not
      do it justice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hawke then bent forward, and repeated&mdash;&ldquo;'If, when he made the
      declaration of his love, the sensibility that beamed in his eyes was felt
      in his heart, what pleasing sensations and soft alarms might not that
      tender avowal awaken!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from what, ma'am,&rdquo; cried I, astonished, and imagining I had mistaken
      them, &ldquo;is this taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my sister's novel!&rdquo; answered the delighted Lady Say and Sele,
      expecting my raptures to be equal to her own; &ldquo;it's in the 'Mausoleum,'&mdash;did
      not you know that? Well, I can't think how you can write these sweet
      novels! And it's all just like that part. Lord Hawke himself says it's all
      poetry. For my part, I'm sure I never could write so. I suppose, Miss
      Burney, you are producing another,&mdash;a'n't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dare say you are. I dare say you are writing one this Very minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Paradise now came up to me again, followed by a square man,
      middle-aged, and hum-drum, who, I found was Lord Say and Sele, afterwards
      from the Kirwans, for though they introduced him to me, I was so
      confounded by their vehemence and their manners, that I did not hear his
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Mrs. P., presenting me to him, &ldquo;authoress of
      'Evelina.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Lady Say and Sele, starting up, &ldquo;'tis the authoress of
      'Evelina!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of 'Evelina.' You'd never think it,&mdash;she looks so young, to have so
      much invention, and such an elegant style! Well, I could write a play, I
      think, but I'm sure I could never write a novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you could, if you would try,&rdquo; said Lady Hawke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I could not,&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;I could not get a style&mdash;that's
      the thing&mdash;I could not tell how to get a style! and a novel's nothing
      without a style, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no,&rdquo; said Lady Hawke; &ldquo;that's true. But then you write such charming
      letters, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters!&rdquo; repeated Lady S. and S. simpering; &ldquo;do you think so? Do you
      know I wrote a long letter to Mrs. Ray just before I came here, this very
      afternoon,&mdash;quite a long letter! I did, I assure you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs. Paradise came forward with another gentleman, younger, slimmer,
      and smarter, and saying to me, &ldquo;Sir Gregory Page Turner,&rdquo; said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, authoress of 'Evelina.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At which Lady Say and Sele, In fresh transport, again rose, and
      rapturously again repeated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she's authoress of 'Evelina'! Have you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; is it to be had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, yes! it's been printed these two years! You'd never think it!
      But it's the most elegant novel I ever read in my life. Writ in such a
      style!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he very civilly; &ldquo;I have every inducement to get it.
      Pray where is it to be had? everywhere, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nowhere, I hope,&rdquo; cried I, wishing at that moment it had been never
      in human ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      My square friend, Lord Say and Sele, then putting his head forward, said,
      very solemnly, &ldquo;I'll purchase it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lady then mentioned to me a hundred novels that I had never heard of,
      asking my opinion of them, and whether I knew the authors? Lady Hawke only
      occasionally and languidly joining in the discourse: and then Lady S. and
      S., suddenly rising, begged me not to move, for she should be back again
      in a minute, and flew to the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took, however, the first opportunity of Lady Hawke's casting down her
      eyes, and reclining her delicate head, to make away from this terrible
      set; and, just as I was got by the pianoforte, where I hoped Pacchierotti
      would soon present himself, Mrs. Paradise again came to me, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, Lady Say and Sele wishes vastly to cultivate your
      acquaintance, and begs to know if she may have the honour of your company
      to an assembly at her house next Friday?&mdash;and I will do myself the
      pleasure to call for you if you will give me leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship does me much honour, but I am unfortunately engaged,&rdquo; was my
      answer, with as much promptness as I could command.

    <h2>
      A DINNER AT SIR JOSHUA'S, WITH BURKE AND GIBBON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>June.</i>&mdash;Among the many I have been obliged to shirk this year,
      for the sake of living almost solely with &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; none have had less
      patience with my retirement than Miss Palmer, who, bitterly believing I
      intended never to visit her again, has forborne sending me any
      invitations: but, about three weeks ago, my father had a note from Sir
      Joshua Reynolds, to ask him to dine at Richmond, and meet the Bishop of
      St. Asaph,<a href="#linknote-148" name="linknoteref-148"
       id="linknoteref-148">[148]</a> and, therefore, to make my peace, I
      scribbled a note to Miss Palmer to this purpose,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the many kind invitations I have been obliged to refuse, will you,
      my dear Miss Palmer, should I offer to accompany my father to-morrow, bid
      me remember the old proverb,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Those who will not when they may,
     When they will, they shall have nay?'&mdash;F.B.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This was graciously received; and the next morning Sir Joshua and Miss
      Palmer called for my father and me, accompanied by Lord Cork. We had a
      mighty pleasant ride, Miss Palmer and I &ldquo;made up,&rdquo; though she scolded most
      violently about my long absence, and attacked me about the book without
      mercy. The book, in short, to my great consternation, I find is talked of
      and expected all the town over. My dear father himself, I do verily
      believe, mentions it to everybody; he is fond of it to enthusiasm, and
      does not foresee the danger of raising such general expectation, which
      fills me with the horrors every time I am tormented with the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua's house is delightfully situated, almost at the top of Richmond
      Hill. We walked till near dinner-time upon the terrace, and there met Mr.
      Richard Burke, the brother of the orator. Miss Palmer, stopping him, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming to dine with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I shall dine at the Star and Garter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come&mdash;with Mrs. Burke, or alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, on horseback?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sure!&rdquo; cried he, laughing; &ldquo;up and ride! Now's the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he made a fine flourish with his hand, and passed us. He is just made
      under-secretary at the Treasury. He is a tall and handsome man, and seems
      to have much dry drollery; but we saw no more of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our return to the house, and while Sir Joshua and I were
      tete-a-tete, Lord Cork and my father being still walking, and Miss Palmer
      having, I suppose, some orders to give about the dinner, the &ldquo;knight of
      Plympton&rdquo; was desiring my opinion of the prospect from his window, and
      comparing it with Mr. Burke's, as he told me after I had spoken it,&mdash;when
      the Bishop of St. Asaph and his daughter, Miss Georgiana Shipley, were
      announced. Sir Joshua, to divert himself, in introducing me to the bishop,
      said, &ldquo;Miss Burney, my lord; otherwise 'Evelina.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bishop is a well-looking man, and seemed grave, quiet, and sensible. I
      have heard much more of him, but nothing more appeared. Miss Georgiana,
      however, was showy enough for two. She is a very tall and rather handsome
      girl; but the expression of her face is, to me, disagreeable. She has
      almost a constant smile, not of softness, nor of insipidity, but of
      self-sufficiency and internal satisfaction. She is very much accomplished,
      and her fame for painting and for scholarship, I know you are well
      acquainted with. I believe her to have very good parts and much quickness,
      but she is so full of herself, so earnest to obtain notice, and so happy
      in her confidence of deserving it, that I have been not less charmed with
      any young lady I have seen for many a day. I have met with her before, at
      Mrs. Pepys', but never before was introduced to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Palmer soon joined us; and, in a short time, entered more company,&mdash;three
      gentlemen and one lady; but there was no more ceremony used of
      introductions. The lady, I concluded was Mrs. Burke, wife of the Mr.
      Burke, and was not mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the gentlemen I recollected to be young Burke, her son, whom I once
      met at Sir Joshua's in town, and another of them I knew for Mr. Gibbon:
      but the third I had never seen before. I had been told that the Burke was
      not expected yet I could conclude this gentleman to be no other; he had
      just the air, the manner, the appearance, I had prepared myself to look
      for in him, and there was an evident, a striking superiority in his
      demeanour, his eye, his motions, that announced him no common man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not get at Miss Palmer to satisfy my doubts, and we were soon
      called downstairs to dinner. Sir Joshua and the &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; stopped to speak
      with one another upon the stairs; and, when they followed us, Sir Joshua,
      in taking his place at the table, asked me to sit next to him; I willingly
      complied. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Mr. Burke shall sit on the other side of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, indeed!&rdquo; cried Miss Georgiana, who also had placed herself next
      Sir Joshua; &ldquo;I won't consent to that; Mr. Burke must sit next me; I won't
      agree to part with him. Pray, come and sit down quiet, Mr. Burke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burke,&mdash;for him it was,&mdash;smiled and obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only meant,&rdquo; said Sir Joshua, &ldquo;to have made my peace with Mr. Burke, by
      giving him that place, because he has been scolding me for not introducing
      him to Miss Burney. However, I must do it now;&mdash;Mr. Burke!&mdash;Miss
      Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both half rose, and Mr. Burke said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been complaining to Sir Joshua that he left me wholly to my own
      sagacity; however, it did not here deceive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, then,&rdquo; said Miss Georgiana, looking a little consternated,
      &ldquo;perhaps you won't thank me for calling you to this place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was said, and so we all began dinner,&mdash;young Burke making
      himself my next neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Phillips<a href="#linknote-149" name="linknoteref-149"
       id="linknoteref-149">[149]</a> knows Mr. Burke. Has he or has he not told
      you how delightful a creature he is? If he has not, pray in my name, abuse
      him without mercy; if he has, pray ask if he will subscribe to my account
      of him, which herewith shall follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is tall, his figure is noble, his air commanding, his address graceful,
      his voice is clear, penetrating, sonorous, and powerful, his language is
      copious, various, and eloquent; his manners are attractive, his
      conversation is delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      What says Captain Phillips? Have I chanced to see him in his happiest
      hour? or is he all this in common? Since we lost Garrick I have seen
      nobody so enchanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can give you, however, very little of what was said, for the
      conversation was not suivie, Mr. Burke darting from subject to subject
      with as much rapidity as entertainment. Neither is the charm of his
      discourse more in the matter than the manner: all, therefore, that is
      related from him loses half its effect in not being related by him. Such
      little sketches as I can recollect take however.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window of the dining-parlour, Sir Joshua directed us to look at a
      pretty white house which belonged to Lady Di Beauclerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am extremely glad,&rdquo; said Mr. Burke, &ldquo;to see her at last so well housed;
      poor woman! the bowl has long rolled in misery; I rejoice that it has now
      found its balance. I never, myself, so much enjoyed the sight of happiness
      in another, as in that woman when I first saw her after the death of her
      husband. It was really enlivening to behold her placed in that sweet
      house, released from all her cares, a thousand pounds a-year at her own
      disposal, and&mdash;her husband was dead! Oh, it was pleasant, it was
      delightful to see her enjoyment of her situation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, without considering the circumstances,&rdquo; said Mr. Gibbon, &ldquo;this may
      appear very strange, though, when they are fairly stated, it is perfectly
      rational and unavoidable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Mr. Burke, &ldquo;if the circumstances are not considered,
      Lady Di may seem highly reprehensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then, addressing himself particularly to me, as the person least likely
      to be acquainted with the character of Mr. Beauclerk, drew it himself in
      strong and marked expressions, describing the misery he gave his wife, his
      singular ill-treatment of her, and the necessary relief the death of such
      a man must give.<a href="#linknote-150" name="linknoteref-150"
       id="linknoteref-150">[150]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He then reminded Sir Joshua of a day in which they had dined at Mr.
      Beauclerk's, soon after his marriage with Lord Bolingbroke's divorced
      wife, in company with Goldsmith, and told a new story of poor Goldsmith's
      eternal blundering.

    <h2>
      A LETTER FROM BURKE To FANNY BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whitehall, July 29, 1782.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam,
    </p>
    <p>
      I should feel exceedingly to blame if I could refuse to myself the natural
      satisfaction, and to you the just but poor return, of my best thanks for
      the very great instruction and entertainment I have received from the new
      present you have bestowed on the public. There are few&mdash;I believe I
      may say fairly there are none at all&mdash;that will not find themselves
      better informed concerning human nature, and their stock of observation
      enriched, by reading your &ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo; They certainly will, let their
      experience in life and manners be what it may. The arrogance of age must
      submit to be taught by youth. You have crowded into a few small volumes an
      incredible variety of characters; most of them well planned, well
      supported, and well contrasted with each other. If there be any fault in
      this respect, It is one in which you are in no great danger of being
      imitated. Justly as your characters are drawn, perhaps they are too
      numerous. But I beg pardon; I fear it is quite in vain to preach economy
      to those who are come young to excessive and sudden opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might trespass on your delicacy if I should fill my letter with what I
      fill my conversation to others. I should be troublesome to you alone if I
      should tell you all I feel and think on the natural vein of humour, the
      tender pathetic, the comprehensive and noble moral, and the sagacious
      observance, that appear quite throughout that extraordinary performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an age distinguished by producing extraordinary women, I hardly dare to
      tell you where my opinion would place you amongst them. I respect your
      modesty, that will not endure the commendations which your merit forces
      from everybody.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY SITS FOR HER PORTRAIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Chesington, Monday, Aug. 12</i>&mdash;I set out for this ever dear
      place, accompanied by Edward,<a href="#linknote-151" name="linknoteref-151"
       id="linknoteref-151">[151]</a> who was sent for to paint Mr. Crisp for my
      father. I am sure you will rejoice in this. I was a little dumpish in the
      journey, for I seemed leaving my Susan again. However, I read a &ldquo;Rambler&rdquo;
       or two, and &ldquo;composed the harmony of my temper,&rdquo; as well as I could, for
      the sake of Edward, who was not only faultless of this, but who is, I
      almost think, faultless of all things. I have thought him more amiable and
      deserving, than ever, since this last sojourn under the same roof with
      him; and, as it happened, I have owed to him almost all the comfort I have
      this time met with here.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came in a chaise, which was well loaded with canvasses, pencils, and
      painting materials; for Mr. Crisp was to be three times painted, and Mrs.
      Gast once. My sweet father came down Gascoign-lane to meet us, in very
      pood spirits and very good health. Next came dear daddy Crisp, looking
      vastly well, and, as usual, high in glee and kindness at the meeting. Then
      the affectionate Kitty, the good Mrs. Hamilton, the gentle Miss Young, and
      the enthusiastic Mrs. Gast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant dinner was over, to my utter surprise and consternation, I was
      called into the room appropriated for Edward and his pictures, and
      informed I was to sit to him for Mr. Crisp! Remonstrances were unavailing,
      and declarations of aversion to the design were only ridiculed; both
      daddies interfered, and, when I ran off, brought me back between them, and
      compelled my obedience;&mdash;and from that time to this, nothing has gone
      forward but picture-sitting.

      GENERAL PAOLI.<a href="#linknote-152" name="linknoteref-152"
       id="linknoteref-152">[152]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      FANNY BURNEY to MR. CRISP
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 15, 1782.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... I am very sorry you could not come to Streatham at the time Mrs.
      Thrale hoped to see you, for when shall we be likely to meet there again?
      You would have been much pleased, I am sure, by meeting with General
      Paoli, who spent the day there, and was extremely communicative and
      agreeable. I had seen him in large companies, but was never made known to
      him before; nevertheless, he conversed with me as if well acquainted not
      only with myself, but my connexions,&mdash;inquiring of me when I had last
      seen Mrs. Montagu? and calling Sir Joshua Reynolds, when he spoke of him,
      my friend. He is a very pleasing man, tall and genteel in his person,
      remarkably well bred, and very mild and soft in his manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will try to give you a little specimen of his conversation, because I
      know you love to hear particulars of all out-of-the-way persons. His
      English is blundering but not unpretty. Speaking of his first acquaintance
      with Mr. Boswell,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to my country, and he fetched me some letter of
      recommending him; but I was of the belief he might be an impostor, and I
      supposed, in my mind, he was an espy; for I look away from him, and in a
      moment I look to him again, and I behold his tablets. Oh! he was to the
      work of writing down all I say! Indeed I was angry. But soon I discover he
      was no impostor and no espy; and I only find I was myself the monster he
      had come to discern. Oh,&mdash;is a very good man! I love him indeed; so
      cheerful! so gay! so pleasant! but at the first, oh! I was indeed angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this he told us a story of an expectation he had of being robbed,
      and of the protection he found from a very large dog that he is very fond
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walk out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the night; I go towards the field; I behold a
      man&mdash;oh, ugly one! I proceed&mdash;he follow; I go on&mdash;he
      address me. 'You have one dog,' he says. 'Yes,' say I to him. 'Is a fierce
      dog?' he says; 'is he fiery?' 'Yes,' reply I, 'he can bite.' 'I would not
      attack in the night,' says he, 'a house to have such dog in it.' Then I
      conclude he was a breaker, so I turn to him&mdash;-oh, very rough! not
      gentle&mdash;and I say, very fierce, 'He shall destroy you, if you are
      ten!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, speaking of the Irish giant, who is now shown in town, he
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so large I am as a baby! I look at him&mdash;oh! I find myself so
      little as a child! Indeed, my indignation it rises when I see him hold up
      his hand so high. I am as nothing; and I find myself in the power of a man
      who fetches from me half a crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This language, which is all spoke very pompously by him, sounds comical
      from himself, though I know not how it may read.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;CECILIA&rdquo;: A PAEAN OF PRAISE: LAMENTATIONS.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [&ldquo;This is the last visit remembered, or, at least, narrated,
     of Streatham.&rdquo;  With these words Madame D'Arblay concludes
     the account given in the &ldquo;Memoirs of Dr. Burney,&rdquo; of her
     meeting with General Paoli.  In the autumn Of 1782 Mrs.
     Thrale went, with her daughters and Dr. Johnson, to
     Brighthelmstone, where Fanny joined them.  On their return
     to London, November 20, the Thrales settled for the winter
     in Argyle-street, and Fanny repaired to her father's
     residence in St. Martin's Street.  She saw much of Mrs.
     Thrale during the winter, but in the following April that
     lady quitted London for Bath, where she resided until her
     marriage with Signor Piozzi in the summer of 1784.  She
     maintained an affectionate correspondence with Fanny until
     after the marriage, but from the date of their parting in
     London, they saw no more of each other, except for one brief
     interval in May, 1784, for several years.

     We must here give an account, as concise as possible, of the
     transaction which was so bitterly resented by the friends of
     Mrs. Thrale, but in which her conduct seems to us, taking
     all the circumstances fairly into consideration, to have
     been less deserving of condemnation than their
     uncharitableness.  She had first seen Piozzi, an Italian
     singer, at a party at Dr. Burney's in 1777, and her
     behaviour to him on that occasion had certainly afforded no
     premonition of her subsequent infatuation.  Piozzi, who was
     nearly of the same age as herself, was, as Miss Seward
     describes him, &ldquo;a handsome man, with gentle, pleasing,
     unaffected manners, and with very eminent skill in his
     profession.&rdquo;  He was requested by Dr. Burney to sing; rather
     unfortunately, it would appear, for the company, which
     included Johnson and the Grevilles, was by no means composed
     of musical enthusiasts, and Mrs. Thrale, in particular,
     &ldquo;knew not a flat from a sharp, nor a crotchet from a
     quaver.&rdquo;  However, he complied; and Mrs. Thrale, after
     sitting awhile in silence, finding the proceedings dull, was
     seized with a desire to enliven them.  &ldquo;In a fit of utter
     recklessness, she suddenly, but softly, arose, and stealing
     on tiptoe behind Signor Piozzi, who was accompanying himself
     on the pianoforte to an animated aria parlante, with his
     back to the company and his face to the wall, she
     ludicrously began imitating him by squaring her elbows,
     elevating them with ecstatic shrugs of the shoulders, and
     casting up her eyes, while languishingly reclining her head;
     as if she were not less enthusiastically, though somewhat
     more suddenly, struck with the transports of harmony than
     himself.

     &ldquo;But the amusement which such an unlooked-for exhibition&mdash;
     caused to the party, was momentary; for Dr. Burney, shocked
     lest the poor signor should observe, and be hurt by this
     mimicry, glided gently round to Mrs. Thrale, and, with
     something between pleasantry and severity, whispered to her,
     'Because, madam, you have no ear yourself for music, will
     you destroy the attention of all who, in that one point, are
     otherwise gifted?'&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-153" name="linknoteref-153"
       id="linknoteref-153">[153]</a>

     This deserved rebuke the lively lady took in perfectly good
     part, and the incident passed without further notice.  She
     does not appear to have met with Piozzi again, Until, in
     July, 1780, she picked him up at Brighton.  She now
     finds him &ldquo;amazingly like her father,&rdquo; and insists that he
     shall teach Hester music. From this point the fever
     gradually increased.  In August, 1781, little more than four
     months after her husband's death, Piozzi has become &ldquo;a
     prodigious favourite&rdquo; with her; she has even developed a
     taste for his music, which &ldquo;fills the mind with emotions one
     would not be without, though inconvenient enough sometimes.&rdquo;
      In the spring Of 1783, soon after her arrival at Bath, they
     were formally engaged, but the urgent remonstrances of her
     friends and family caused the engagement to be broken off,
     and Piozzi went to Italy.  Her infatuation, however, was too
     strong to be overcome.  Under the struggle, long protracted,
     her health gave way, and at length, by the advice of her
     doctor, and with the sullen consent of Miss Thrale, Piozzi
     was summoned to Bath.  He, too, had been faithful, and he
     lost no time in obeying the summons.  They were married,
     according to the Roman Catholic rites, in London, and again,
     on the 25th of July, 1784, in a Protestant church at Bath,
     her three elder daughters, of whom the eldest, Hester
     (&ldquo;Queeny&rdquo;), was not yet twenty years of age, having quitted
     Bath before his arrival.

     Mrs. Piozzi left England with her husband and her youngest
     daughter, Cecilia, and lived for some years in Italy, where
     she compiled her well known &ldquo;Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson.&rdquo;  Her
     wedded life with Piozzi was certainly happy, and he gave her
     no reason to repent the step she had taken.  The indignation
     of her former friends, especially of Dr. Johnson, was
     carried to a length which, the cause being considered,
     appears little short of ridiculous.  Mrs. Thrale's second
     marriage may have been ill-advised, but it was neither
     criminal nor disgraceful.  Piozzi was incontestably a
     respectable man and a constant lover; but that an Italian
     musician, who depended upon his talents for his livelihood,
     should become the husband of the celebrated Mrs. Thrale, and
     the stepfather of four young ladies of fashion, the
     daughters of a brewer, and the heiresses to his large
     fortune,&mdash;there was the rub!  The dislike of Dr. Johnson and
     his friends to the marriage was, from a worldly point of
     view, justifiable enough, but it argues ill for their
     generosity of mind that they should have attached such
     overwhelming importance to such petty considerations.  Mrs.
     Piozzi has been blamed for deserting her three elder
     daughters; but the fact is, it was her daughters who
     deserted her, and refused to recognise her husband.  Her
     only fault, if fault it can be called, was in declining to
     sacrifice the whole happiness of her life to the supposed
     requirements of their rank in society.  In condemning her
     friends for their severity and illiberality, we must,
     however, make an exception in favour of Fanny.  She, like
     the rest, had been averse to the match, but her cordiality
     to Mrs. Piozzi remained undiminished; and when, soon after
     the marriage, their correspondence was discontinued, to be
     renewed only after the lapse of many years, it was not
     Fanny, but Mrs. Piozzi, who broke it off, instigated, Fanny
     always believed, by her husband.

     Her separation from Mrs. Thrale was not the only event which
     brought sorrow to Fanny during the years to which the
     following section of the Diary relates.  Mr. Crisp, the
     person dearest to her of all human beings outside her own
     family, died at Chesington, of an attack of his old malady,
     the gout, on the 24th of April, 1783, aged seventy-five.
     Fanny and Susan were with him at the last, and Fanny's love
     was rewarded, her anguish soothed yet deepened, when, almost
     with his dying breath, her Daddy Crisp called her &ldquo;the
     dearest thing to him on earth.&rdquo;

     Towards the end of 1784 another heavy blow fell upon Fanny,
     in the loss of Dr. Johnson, who died on the 13th of
     December.  The touching references in the Diary to his last
     illness form an interesting supplement to Boswell's
     narrative.

     But the picture of Fanny's life during these years is not
     without bright touches.  As such we may reckon the great,
     and deserved success of her novel, &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo;; the
     commencement of her acquaintance with two ladies who were
     hereafter to be numbered among her dearest friends&mdash;the
     venerable Mrs. Delany, and Mrs. Locke, of Norbury Park,
     Surrey; and last, not least, the growing intimacy between
     Edmund Burke and the family of Dr. Burney.&mdash;ED.]

    <h2>
      AT BRIGHTON AGAIN, THE &ldquo;FAmous Miss BURNEY.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <h3>
      Brighthelmstone, Oct. 26.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My journey was incidentless&mdash;-but the moment I came into
      Brighthelmstone I was met by Mrs. Thrale, who had most eagerly been
      waiting for me a long while, and therefore I dismounted, and walked home
      with her. It would be very superfluous to tell you how she received me,
      for you cannot but know, from her impatient letters, what I had reason to
      expect of kindness and welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson received me, too, with his usual goodness, and with a salute
      so loud, that the two young beaus, Cotton and Swinerton, have never done
      laughing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale spent two or three hours in my room, talking over all her
      affairs, and then we wished each other bon repos, and&mdash;retired.
      Grandissima conclusion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, but let me not forget that a fine note came from Mr. Pepys, who is
      here with his family, saying he was pressde de vivre, and entreating to
      see Mrs. and Miss T., Dr. Johnson, and Cecilia at his house the next day.
      I hate mightily this method of naming me from my heroines, of whose honour
      I think I am more jealous than of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Oct. 27</i>&mdash;The Pepyses came to visit me in form, but I was
      dressing; in the evening, however, Mrs. and Miss T. took me to them. Dr.
      Johnson would not go; he told me it was my day, and I should be crowned,
      for Mr. Pepys was wild about &ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo; We found at Mr. Pepys' nobody but
      his wife, his brother, Dr. Pepys,<a href="#linknote-154"
       name="linknoteref-154" id="linknoteref-154">[154]</a> and Dr. Pepys' lady,
      Countess of Rothes. Mr. Pepys received me with such distinction, that it
      was very evident how much the book, with the most flattering opinion of
      it, was in his head; however, he behaved very prettily, and only mentioned
      it by allusions; most particularly upon the character of Meadows, which he
      took various opportunities of pronouncing to be the &ldquo;best hit possible&rdquo;
       upon the present race of fine gentlemen. We did not stay with them long,
      but called upon Miss Benson, and proceeded to the rooms. Mr. Pepys was
      very unwilling to part with us, and wanted to frighten me from going, by
      saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has Miss Burney the courage to venture to the Rooms? I wonder she
      dares!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not seem to understand him, though to mistake him was impossible.
      However, I thought of him again when I was at the rooms, for most violent
      was the staring and whispering as I passed and repassed! insomuch that I
      shall by no means be in any haste to go again to them. Susan and Sophy
      Thrale, who were with their aunt, Mrs. Scott, told Queeny upon our return
      that they heard nothing said, whichever way they turned, but &ldquo;That's she!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;That's the famous Miss Burney!&rdquo; I shall certainly escape going any more,
      if it is in my power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, Oct. 28.</i>&mdash;Mr. Pepys had but just left me, when Mrs.
      Thrale sent Susan with a particular request to see me in her
      dressing-room, where I found her with a milliner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Burney,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I could not help promising Mrs. Cockran
      that she should have a sight of you&mdash;she has begged it so hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may believe I stared; and the woman, whose eyes almost looked ready to
      eat me, eagerly came up to me, exclaiming,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ma'am, you don't know what a favour this is to see you! I have longed
      for it so long! It is quite a comfort to me, indeed. Oh, ma'am, how clever
      you must be! All the ladies I deal with are quite distracted about
      'Cecilia,'&mdash;and I got it myself. Oh, ma'am, how sensible you must be!
      It does my heart good to see you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON DOGMATISES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Oct. 29.</i>&mdash;We had a large party at home in the evening. I was
      presently engaged by Mr. Pepys, and he was joined by Mr. Coxe, and he by
      Miss Benson. Mr. Pepys led the conversation, and it was all upon criticism
      and poetry. The little set was broken up by my retreat, and Mr. Pepys
      joined Dr. Johnson, with whom he entered into an argument upon some lines
      of Gray, and upon Pope's definition of wit, in which he was so roughly
      confuted, and so severely ridiculed, that he was hurt and piqued beyond
      all power of disguise, and, in the midst of the discourse, suddenly turned
      from him, and, wishing Mrs. Thrale good night, very abruptly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson was certainly right with respect to the argument and to
      reason; but his opposition was so warm, and his wit so satirical and
      exulting, that I was really quite grieved to see how unamiable he
      appeared, and how greatly he made himself dreaded by all, and by many
      abhorred. What pity that he will not curb the vehemence of his love of
      victory and superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sum of the dispute was this. Wit being talked of, Mr. Pepys repeated,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;True wit is Nature to advantage dress'd,
     What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, sir,&rdquo; cried Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;is a definition both false and foolish.
      Let wit be dressed how it will, it will equally be wit, and neither the
      more nor the less for any advantage dress can give it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P.-But, sir, may not wit be so ill expressed, and so obscure, by a bad
      speaker, as to be lost?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-The fault, then, sir, must be with the hearer. If a man cannot
      distinguish wit from words, he little deserves to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P.-But, sir, what Pope means&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Sir, what Pope means, if he means what he says, is both false and
      foolish. In the first place, 'what oft was thought,' is all the worse for
      being often thought, because to be wit, it ought to be newly thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P.-But, sir, 'tis the expression makes it new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-How can the expression make it new? It may make it clear, or may
      make it elegant&mdash;-but how new? You are confounding words with things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P.-But, sir, if one man says a thing very ill, may not another man say
      it so much better that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-That other man, sir, deserves but small praise for the amendment;
      he is but the tailor to the first man's thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. P.-True, sir, he may be but the tailor; but then the difference is as
      great as between a man in a gold lace suit and a man in a blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.-Just so, sir, I thank you for that; the difference is precisely
      such, since it consists neither in the gold lace suit nor the blanket, but
      in the man by whom they are worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the summary; the various contemptuous sarcasms intermixed would
      fill, and very unpleasantly, a quire.

    <h2>
      A CUNNING RUNAWAY HEIRESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Oct. 30.</i>&mdash;Lady Warren is immensely tall, and extremely
      beautiful; she is now but just nineteen, though she has been married two
      or three years. She is giddy, gay, chatty, good-humoured, and a little
      affected; she hazards all that occurs to her, seems to think the world at
      her feet, and is so young and gay and handsome that she is not much
      mistaken. She is, in short, an inferior Lady Honoria Pemberton;<a
      href="#linknote-155" name="linknoteref-155" id="linknoteref-155">[155]</a>
      somewhat beneath her in parts and understanding, but strongly in that
      class of character. I had no conversation with her myself; but her voice
      is loud and deep, and all she said was for the whole room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marriages being talked of, &ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;a story; that is,
      it sha'n't be a story, but a fact. A lady of my acquaintance, who had
      50,000L. fortune, ran away to Scotland with a gentleman she liked vastly;
      so she was a little doubtful of him, and had a mind to try him: so when
      they stopped to dine, and change horses, and all that, she said, 'Now, as
      I have a great regard for you, I dare say you have for me&mdash;so I will
      tell you a secret: I have got no fortune at all, in reality, but only
      5,000 pounds; for all the rest is a mere pretence: but if you like me for
      myself, and not for my fortune, you won't mind that.' So the gentleman
      said, 'Oh, I don't regard it at all, and you are the same charming angel
      that ever you was,' and all those sort of things that people say to one,
      and then went out to see about the chaise. So he did not come back; but
      when dinner was ready, the lady said 'Pray, where is he?' 'Lor, ma'am,'
      said they, 'why, that gentleman has been gone ever so long!' So she came
      back by herself; and now she's married to somebody else, and has her
      50,000 pounds fortune all safe.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON A BORE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday, November 2.</i>&mdash;We went to Lady Shelley's. Dr. Johnson,
      again, excepted in the invitation. He is almost constantly omitted, either
      from too much respect or too much fear. I am sorry for it, as he hates
      being alone, and as, though he scolds the others, he is well enough
      satisfied himself, and having given vent to all his own occasional anger
      or ill-humour, he is ready to begin again, and is never aware that those
      who have so been &ldquo;downed&rdquo; by him, never can much covet so triumphant a
      visitor. In contests of wit, the victor is as ill off in future
      consequences as the vanquished in present ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, November 4.</i>&mdash;This was a grand and busy day. Mr.
      Swinerton has been some time arranging a meeting for all our house, with
      Lady De Ferrars, whom you may remember as Charlotte Ellerker, and her lord
      and sisters: and this morning it took place, by mutual appointment, at his
      lodgings, where we met to breakfast. Dr. Johnson, who already knew Lord De
      Ferrars, and Mrs. and Miss Thrale, and myself, arrived first and then came
      the Lord and Lady, and Miss Ellerker and her youngest sister, Harriet.
      Lord De Ferrars is very ugly, but extremely well-bred, gentle, unassuming,
      sensible, and pleasing. His lady is much improved since we knew her in
      former days, and seems good-humoured, lively, and rather agreeable. Miss
      Ellerker is nothing altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I happened to be standing by Dr. Johnson when all the ladies came in; but,
      as I dread him before strangers, from the staring attention he attracts
      both for himself and all with whom he talks, I endeavoured to change my
      ground. However, he kept prating a sort of comical nonsense that detained
      me some minutes whether I would or not; but when we were all taking places
      at the breakfast-table I made another effort to escape. It proved vain; he
      drew his chair next to mine, and went rattling on in a humorous sort of
      comparison he was drawing of himself to me,&mdash;not one word of which
      could I enjoy, or can I remember, from the hurry I was in to get out of
      his way. In short, I felt so awkward from being thus marked out, that I
      was reduced to whisper a request to Mr. Swinerton to put a chair between
      us, for which I presently made a space: for I have often known him stop
      all conversation with me, when he has ceased to have me for his next
      neighbour. Mr. Swinerton who is an extremely good-natured young man, and
      so intimate here that I make no scruple with him, instantly complied, and
      placed himself between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sooner was this done, than Dr. Johnson, half seriously, and very
      loudly, took him to task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How now, sir! what do you mean by this? Would you separate me from Miss
      Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Swinerton, a little startled, began some apologies, and Mrs. Thrale
      winked at him to give up the place; but he was willing to oblige me,
      though he grew more and more frightened every minute, and coloured
      violently as the Doctor continued his remonstrance, which he did with
      rather unmerciful raillery, upon his taking advantage of being in his own
      house to thus supplant him, and cram; but when he had borne it for about
      ten minutes, his face became so hot with the fear of hearing something
      worse, that he ran from the field, and took a chair between Lady De
      Ferrars and Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I shall take warning by this failure, to trust only to my own
      expedients for avoiding his public notice in future. However it stopped
      here; for Lord De Ferrars came in, and took the disputed place without
      knowing of the contest, and all was quiet.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY WILL NOT BE PERSUADED TO DANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ... Late as it was, it was settled we should go to the ball, the last for
      the season being this night. My own objections about going not being
      strong enough to combat the ado my mentioning them would have occasioned,
      I joined in the party, without demur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball was half over, and all the company seated to tea. Mr. Wade<a
      href="#linknote-156" name="linknoteref-156" id="linknoteref-156">[156]</a>
      came to receive us all, as usual, and we had a table procured for us, and
      went to tea ourselves, for something to do. When this repast was over, the
      company returned to their recreation. The room was very thin, and almost
      half the ladies danced with one another, though there were men enough
      present, I believe, had they chosen such exertion; but the Meadowses at
      balls are in crowds. Some of the ladies were in riding habits, and they
      made admirable men. 'Tis tonnish to be so much undressed at the last ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of our usual friends, the Shelleys, Hatsels, Dickens, or Pepys, were
      here, and we, therefore, made no party&mdash;but Mrs. Thrale and I stood
      at the top of the room to look on the dancing, and as we were thus
      disengaged, she was seized with a violent desire to make one among them,
      and I felt myself an equal inclination. She proposed, as so many women
      danced together, that we two should, and nothing should I have liked so
      well; but I begged her to give up the scheme, as that would have
      occasioned more fuss and observation than our dancing with all the men
      that ever were born.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were debating this matter, a gentleman suddenly said to me,&mdash;&ldquo;Did
      you walk far this morning, Miss Burney?&rdquo; And, looking at him, I saw Mr.
      Metcalf,<a href="#linknote-157" name="linknoteref-157" id="linknoteref-157">[157]</a>
      whose graciousness rather surprised me, for he only made to Mrs. Thrale a
      cold and distant bow, and it seems he declares, aloud and around, his
      aversion to literary ladies. That he can endure, and even seek me is, I
      presume, only from the general perverseness of mankind, because he sees I
      have always turned from him; not, however, from disliking him, for he is a
      shrewd, sensible, keen, and very clever man; but merely from a dryness on
      his own side that has excited retaliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;we walked a good way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;told me in the morning you were no walker; but I
      informed him then I had had the pleasure of seeing you upon the Newmarket
      Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he does not know,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;whether I am a walker or not&mdash;he
      does not see me walk, because he never walks himself.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was called away by some gentleman, but presently came to me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall you dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;has desired me to speak to you for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, Susanna, for the grand moment!&mdash;the height&mdash;the zenith of
      my glory in the ton meridian! I again said I did not mean to dance, and to
      silence all objection, he expressively said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis Captain Kaye<a href="#linknote-158" name="linknoteref-158"
       id="linknoteref-158">[158]</a> who sends me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is not this magnificent? Pray congratulate me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was really very much surprised, but repeated my refusal, with all
      customary civilities to soften it. He was leaving me with this answer,
      when this most flashy young officer, choosing to trust his cause to
      himself, came forward, and desired to be introduced to me. Mr. Metcalf
      performed that ceremony, and he then, with as much respect and deference
      as if soliciting a countess, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I flatter myself you will do me the honour of dancing with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and said the same thing over again. He looked much
      disappointed, and very unwilling to give up his plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;any particular dislike to dancing, it will be
      doing, not only me, but the whole room much honour, if you will make one
      in a set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me much honour, sir,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I must beg you to excuse
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I hope out of charity you will dance, as it is
      the last ball, and the company is so thin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will do very well without me; Mr. Wade himself says he dies
      to-night a very respectable death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you not have the goodness to help it on a little in its last
      stage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, laughing; &ldquo;why should we wish it to be kept lingering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lingering!&rdquo; repeated he, looking round at the dancers, &ldquo;no, surely it is
      not quite so desperate; and if you will but join in, you will give it new
      existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was a little thrown off my guard at this unexpected earnestness, so
      different to the ton of the day, and I began hardly to know what to
      answer, my real objection being such as I could by no means publish,
      though his urgency and his politeness joined would have made me give up
      any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very quiet dance,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there is nothing fatiguing in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I cannot really dance to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry to seem so obstinate, but he was just the man to make every
      body inquire whom he danced with; and any one who wished for general
      attention could do no better than to be his partner. The ever-mischievous
      Mrs. Thrale, calling to Mr. Selwyn, who stood by us, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here's a man in love!&mdash;quite, downright in love with Miss
      Burney, if ever I saw one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is quite mortified, at least,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I never saw a man look
      more mortified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he did not deserve it,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;he knew how to beg, and he ought
      not to have been so served.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I begged her to be silent, for Mr. Metcalf returned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you too much tired,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with your walk this morning, to try
      at a dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I excused myself as well as I could, and we presently went into the
      card-room to vary the scene. When we returned to the ball-room I was very
      glad to see my new captain had just taken out Lady Anne Lindsay, who is
      here with Lady Margaret Fordyce, and who dances remarkably well, and was
      every way a more suitable partner for him. He was to leave the town, with
      his regiment, the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Thrale took me out to walk with her. We met
      Lady De Ferrars and Miss Ellerker in our ramble, and the very moment the
      ball was mentioned, this dear and queer creature called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, there was a sad ado, ladies dancing with ladies, and all sorts of odd
      things; and that handsome and fine Mr. Kaye broke his heart almost to
      dance with Miss Burney; but she refused him, and so, in despair, he took
      out Lady Anne Lindsay.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON HELD IN GENERAL DREAD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Mr. Metcalf called upon Dr. Johnson, and took him
      out for an airing. Mr. Hamilton is gone, and Mr. Metcalf is now the only
      person out of this house that voluntarily communicates with the doctor. He
      has been in a terrible severe humour of late, and has really frightened
      all the people, till they almost ran from him. To me only I think he is
      now kind, for Mrs. Thrale fares worse than anybody. 'Tis very strange and
      very melancholy that he will not a little more accommodate his manners and
      language to those of other people. He likes Mr. Metcalf, however, and so
      do I, for he is very clever and entertaining when he pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dr. Delap confessed to us, that the reason he now came so seldom,
      though he formerly almost lived with us when at this place, was his being
      too unwell to cope with Dr. Johnson. And the other day Mr. Selwyn having
      refused an invitation from Mr. Hamilton to meet the doctor, because he
      preferred being here upon a day when he was out, suddenly rose at the time
      he was expected to return, and said he must run away, &ldquo;for fear the doctor
      should call him to account.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      SHORT, FAT, HANDSOME MISS MONCKTON: DUCAL INDIFFERENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, November 10</i>, brings in a new person. The e Honourable Miss
      Monckton,<a href="#linknote-159" name="linknoteref-159"
       id="linknoteref-159">[159]</a> who is here with her mother, the Dowager
      Lady Galway, has sent various messages of her earnest desire to be
      acquainted with Mrs. Thrale and your humble servant to command. Dr.
      Johnson 'she already knew,' for she is one of those who stand foremost in
      collecting all extraordinary or curious people to her London
      conversaziones, which, like those of Mrs. Vesey, mix the rank and file
      literature, and exclude all beside. Well&mdash;after divers intimations of
      this sort, it was at last settled that Lady De Ferrars should bring her
      here this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening came Lady De Ferrars, Miss Monckton, and Miss Ellerker.
      Miss Monckton is between thirty and forty very short, very fat, but
      handsome; splendidly and fantastically dressed, rouged not unbecomingly,
      yet evidently and palpably desirous of gaining notice and admiration. She
      has an easy levity in her air, manner, voice, and discourse, that speak
      all within to be comfortable; and her rage of seeing anything curious may
      be satisfied, if she pleases, by looking in a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can give you no account of the conversation, as it was broken, and not
      entertaining. Miss Monckton went early, having another engagement, but the
      other ladies stayed very late. She told us, however, one story extremely
      well worth recalling. The Duke of Devonshire was standing near a very fine
      glass lustre in a corner of a room, at an assembly, and in a house of
      people who, Miss Monckton said, were by no means in a style of life to
      hold expense as immaterial; and, by carelessly lolling back, he threw the
      lustre down and it was broke. He shewed not, however, the smallest concern
      or confusion at the accident, but coolly said, &ldquo;I wonder how I did that!&rdquo;
       He then removed to the opposite corner, and to shew, I suppose, he had
      forgotten what he had done, leaned his head in the same manner, and down
      came the opposite lustre! He looked at it very calmly, and, with a
      philosophical dryness, merely said, &ldquo;This is singular enough!&rdquo; and walked
      to another part of the room, without either distress or apology.

    <h2>
      MISS MONCKTON'S ASSEMBLY: SACQUES AND RUFFLES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>December 8.</i>&mdash;Now for Miss Monckton's assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had begged Mrs. Thrale to call for me,<a href="#linknote-160"
       name="linknoteref-160" id="linknoteref-160">[160]</a> that I might have
      her countenance and assistance upon my entrance. Miss Thrale came also.
      Every thing was in a new style. We got out of the coach into a hall full
      of servants, not one of which inquired our names, or took any notice of
      us. We proceeded, and went upstairs, and, when we arrived at a door,
      stopped and looked behind us. No servant had followed or preceded us. We
      deliberated what was to be done. To announce ourselves was rather awkward,
      neither could we be sure we were going into the right apartment. I
      proposed going up higher, till we met with somebody; Miss Thrale thought
      we should go down and call some of the servants; but Mrs. Thrale, after a
      ridiculous consultation, determined to try her fortune by opening the
      door. This being done, we entered a room full of tea-things, and one
      maid-servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thrale, laughing, &ldquo;what is to be done now? I suppose we
      are come so early that nothing is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid stared, but said,&mdash;&ldquo;There's company in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we considered again how to make ourselves known; and then Mrs. Thrale
      again resolved to take courage and enter. She therefore opened another
      door, and went into another apartment. I held back, but looked after, and
      observing that she made no curtsey, concluded she was gone into some wrong
      place. Miss Thrale followed, and after her went little I, wondering who
      was to receive, or what was to become of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Monckton lives with her mother, the old Dowager Lady Galway, in a
      noble house in Charles-street, Berkeleysquare, The room was large and
      magnificent. There was not much company, for we were very early. Lady
      Galway sat at the side of the fire, and received nobody. She seems very
      old, and was dressed with a little round white cap, and not a single hair,
      no cushlori, roll, nor any thing else but the little round cap, which was
      flat upon her forehead. Such part of the company as already knew her made
      their compliments to her where she sat, and the rest were never taken up
      to her, but belonged wholly to Miss Monckton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Monckton's own manner of receiving her guests was scarce more
      laborious; for she kept her seat when they entered, and only turned round
      her head to nod it, and say &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; after which they found what
      accommodation they could for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, however, as she perceived Mrs. and Miss Thrale, which was not
      till they had been some minutes in the room, she arose to welcome them,
      contrary to her general Custom, and merely because it was their first
      visit. Our long train making my entrance some time after theirs, gave me
      the advantage of being immediately seen by her, and she advanced to me
      with quickness, and very politely thanked me for coming, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you think me very rude for taking the liberty of sending to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, you did me much honour,&rdquo; quoth I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then broke further into her general rules, by making way for me to a
      good place, and seating me herself, and then taking a chair next me, and
      beginning a little chat. I really felt myself much obliged to her for this
      seasonable attention, for I was presently separated from Mrs. Thrale, and
      entirely surrounded by strangers, all dressed superbly, and all looking
      saucily; and as nobody's names were spoken, I had no chance to discover
      any acquaintances. Mr. Metcalf, indeed, came and spoke to me the instant I
      came in, and I should have been very happy to have had him for my
      neighbour; but he was engaged in attending to Dr. Johnson, who was
      standing near the fire, and environed with listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some new people now coming in, and placing themselves in a regular way,
      Miss Monckton exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;My whole care is to prevent a circle;&rdquo; and
      hastily rising, she pulled about the chairs, and planted the people in
      groups, with as dexterous a disorder as you would desire to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company in general were dressed with more brilliancy than at any rout
      I ever was at, as most of them were going to the Duchess of Cumberland's,
      and attired for that purpose. Just behind me sat Mrs. Hampden, still very
      beautiful, but insufferably affected. Another lady, in full dress, and
      very pretty, came in soon after, and got herself a chair just before me;
      and then a conversation began between her and Mrs. Hampden, of which I
      will give you a specimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How disagreeable these sacques are! I am so incommoded with these nasty
      ruffles! I am going to Cumberland House&mdash;are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hampden, &ldquo;what else, do you think, would make me
      bear this weight of dress? I can't bear a sacque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought you said you should always wear them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, but I have changed my mind since then&mdash;as many people do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it vastly disagreeable indeed,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you can't
      think how I am encumbered with these ruffles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I am quite oppressed with them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hampden, &ldquo;I can hardly bear
      myself up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I dined in this way!&rdquo; cried the other; &ldquo;only think&mdash;dining in a
      sacque!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Hampden, &ldquo;it really puts me quite out of spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this they found some subject less popular, and the lady unknown
      leaned over me, without any ceremony, to whisper with Mrs. Hampden. I
      should have offered her my place if she had made any apology, but as it
      was, I thought she might take her own way. In the course of the evening,
      however, I had the pleasure to observe a striking change in her manners;
      for as soon as she picked up, I know not how, my name, she ceased her
      whispering, looked at me with the civilest smiles, spoke to me two or
      three times, and calling to a fine beau, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do pray sit this way, that you may screen Miss Burney as well as me from
      that fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not, however, sufficiently like her beginning, to accept her
      challenge of talking, and only coldly answered by yes, no, or a bow.

    <h2>
      AT MISS MONCKTON'S: &ldquo;CECILIA&rdquo; EXTOLLED BY THE &ldquo;OLD WITS,&rdquo; AND BY BURKE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then came in Sir Joshua Reynolds, and he soon drew a chair near mine, and
      from that time I was never without some friend at my elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Mrs. Montagu lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But within these few months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not since last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must see her, then. You ought to see and to hear her&mdash;'t
      will be worth your while. Have you heard of the fine long letter she has
      written?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I have not met with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is it to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old Duchess of Portland.<a href="#linknote-161" name="linknoteref-161"
       id="linknoteref-161">[161]</a> She desired Mrs. Montagu's opinion of
      'Cecilia,' and she has written it at full length. I was in a party at her
      grace's, and heard of nothing but you. She is so delighted, and so
      sensibly, so rationally, that I only wish you could have heard her. And
      old Mrs. Delany had been forced to begin it, though she had said she
      should never read any more; however, when we met, she was reading it
      already for the third time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this Mrs. Burke saw me, and with much civility and softness of
      manner, came and talked with me, while her husband without seeing me, went
      behind my chair to speak to Mrs Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Monckton, returning to me, then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, I had the pleasure yesterday of seeing Mrs. Greville."<a
      href="#linknote-162" name="linknoteref-162" id="linknoteref-162">[162]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose she concluded I was very intimate with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen her,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, however,&rdquo; cried she, looking surprised, &ldquo;she is your godmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she does not do her duty and answer for me, for I never see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have answered very well for yourself! But I know by that your
      name is Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then tripped to somebody else, and Mr. Burke very quietly came from
      Mrs. Hampden, and sat down in the vacant place at my side. I could then
      wait no longer, for I found he was more near-sighted than myself; I,
      therefore, turned towards him and bowed: he seemed quite amazed, and
      really made me ashamed, however delighted, by the expressive civility and
      distinction with which he instantly rose to return my bow, and stood the
      whole time he was making his compliments upon seeing me, and calling
      himself the blindest of men for not finding me out sooner. And Mrs. Burke,
      who was seated near me, said, loud enough for me to hear her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, see what a flirtation Mr. Burke is beginning with Miss Burney and
      before my face too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These ceremonies over, he sat down by me, and began a conversation which
      you, my dearest Susy, would be glad to hear, for my sake, word for word;
      but which I really could not listen to with sufficient ease, from shame at
      his warm eulogiums, to remember with any accuracy. The general substance,
      however, take as I recollect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many most eloquent compliments upon the book, too delicate either to
      shock or sicken the nicest ear, he very emphatically congratulated me upon
      its most universal success, said, &ldquo;he was now too late to speak of it,
      since he could only echo the voice of the whole nation&rdquo; and added, with a
      laugh, &ldquo;I had hoped to have made some merit of my enthusiasm; but the
      moment I went about to hear what others say, I found myself merely one in
      a multitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then told me that, notwithstanding his admiration, he was the man who
      had dared to find some faults with so favourite and fashionable a work. I
      entreated him to tell me what they were, and assured him nothing would
      make me so happy as to correct them under his direction. He then
      enumerated them: and I will tell you what they are, that you may not
      conclude I write nothing but the fairer part of my adventures, which I
      really always relate very honestly, though so fair they are at this time,
      that it hardly seems possible they should not be dressed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masquerade he thought too long, and that something might be spared
      from Harrel's grand assembly; he did not like Morrice's part of the
      pantheon; and he wished the conclusion either more happy or more miserable
      &ldquo;for in a work of imagination,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no medium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was not easy enough to answer him, or I have much, though perhaps not
      good for much, to say in defence of following life and nature as much in
      the conclusion as in the progress of a tale; and when is life and nature
      completely happy or miserable?
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking very archly at me, and around him, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sitting here for characters? Nothing, by the way, struck me more
      in reading your book than the admirable skill with which your ingenious
      characters make themselves known by their own words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then went on to tell me that I had done the most wonderful of wonders
      in pleasing the old wits, particularly the Duchess of Portland and Mrs.
      Delany, who resisted reading the book till they were teased into it, and,
      since they began, could do nothing else&mdash;and he failed not to point
      out, with his utmost eloquence, the difficulty of giving satisfaction to
      those who piqued themselves upon being past receiving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have one other fault to find, and a more material one
      than any I have mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the more obliged to you. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The disposal of this book. I have much advice to offer to you upon that
      subject. Why did not you send for your own friend out of the city? he
      would have taken care you should not part with it so much below par.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meant Mr. Briggs.<a href="#linknote-163" name="linknoteref-163"
       id="linknoteref-163">[163]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joshua Reynolds now joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you telling her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of our conversation with the old wits? I
      am glad you hear it from Mr. Burke, Miss Burney, for he can tell it so
      much better than I can, and remember their very words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else would they talk of for three whole hours,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we
      were there at the third reading of the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I was in good hands,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if they talked of it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered Sir Joshua, laughing, &ldquo;we joined in from time to
      time. Gibbon says he read the whole five volumes in a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis impossible,&rdquo; cried Mr. Burke, &ldquo;it cost me three days and you know I
      never parted with it from the time I first opened it.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      A WRITER OF ROMANCES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after the parties changed again and young Mr. Burke<a
      href="#linknote-164" name="linknoteref-164" id="linknoteref-164">[164]</a>
      came and sat by me. He is a very civil and obliging, and a sensible and
      agreeable young man. Old Lady Galway trotted from her corner, in the
      middle of the evening, and leaning her hands upon the backs of two chairs,
      put her little round head through two fine high dressed ladies on purpose
      to peep at me, and then trotted back to her place! Ha, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Monckton now came to us again, and I congratulated her upon her power
      in making Dr. Johnson sit in a group upon which she immediately said to
      him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, Miss Burney says you like best to sit in a circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she?&rdquo; said he, laughing; &ldquo;Ay, never mind what she says. Don't you
      know she is a writer of romances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I do, indeed,&rdquo; said Miss Monckton, and every one joined in a
      laugh that put me horribly out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may write romances and speak truth,&rdquo; said my dear Sir Joshua, who, as
      well as young Burke, and Mr. Metcalf, and two strangers, joined now in our
      little party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, indeed, Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Miss Monckton, &ldquo;you must see Mrs.
      Siddons. Won't you see her in some fine part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if I must, madam, I've no choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says, sir, she shall be very much afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, that cannot be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not true,&rdquo; cried Miss Monckton, staring, &ldquo;yes it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she said so to me; I heard her say it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, it is not possible! remember, therefore, in future, that even
      fiction should be supported by probability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Monckton looked all amazement, but insisted upon the&mdash;truth of
      what she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe, madam,&rdquo; said he, warmly, &ldquo;she knows my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is rating her too low,&rdquo; said a gentleman stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By not knowing my name,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I do not mean so literally; but
      that, when she sees it abused in a newspaper, she may possibly recollect
      that she has seen it abused in a newspaper before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Miss Monckton, &ldquo;but you must see her for all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madam, if you desire it, I will go. See her I shall not, nor hear
      her; but I'll go, and that will do. The last time I was at a play, I was
      ordered there by Mrs. Abington, or Mrs. Somebody, I do not well remember
      who; but I placed myself in the middle of the first row of the front
      boxes, to show that when I was called I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The talk upon this matter went on very long, and with great spirit. At
      last, a large party of ladies arose at the same time', and I tripped after
      them; Miss Monckton, however, made me come back, for she said I must else
      wait in the other room till those ladies' carriages drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned, Sir Joshua came and desired he might convey me home; I
      declined the offer, and he pressed it a good deal, drolly saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am old enough, a'n't I?&rdquo; And when he found me stout, he said to
      Dr. Johnson,&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, is not this very hard? Nobody thinks me very
      young, yet Miss Burney won't give me the privilege of age in letting me
      see her home? She says I a'n't old enough."<a href="#linknote-165"
       name="linknoteref-165" id="linknoteref-165">[165]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never said any such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;did I not tell you she was a writer of
      romances?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MRS. WALSINGHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>December 15.</i>&mdash;To-day, by an invitation of ten days standing, I
      waited upon Mrs. Walsingham. She is a woman high in fame for her talents,<a
      href="#linknote-166" name="linknoteref-166" id="linknoteref-166">[166]</a>
      and a wit by birth, as the daughter of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has the character of being only civil to people of birth, fame, or
      wealth, and extremely insolent to all others. Of this, however, I could
      see nothing, since she at least took care to invite no company to her own
      house whom she was disposed to disdain. Her reception of me appeared
      rather singular. She was violently dressed,&mdash;a large hoop, flowers in
      her small and full dressed cap, ribands and ornaments extremely shown, and
      a fan in her hand. She was very polite, said much of her particular
      pleasure in seeing me, and kept advancing to me near, that involuntarily I
      retreated from her, not knowing her design, and kept, therefore, getting
      further and further back as she came forward, till I was stopped from any
      power of moving by the wainscot. I then necessarily stood still, and she
      saluted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then quietly sat down, and my father began a very lively conversation
      upon various subjects; she kept it up with attention and good breeding,
      often referring to me, and seeming curious to know my notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the company who came to dinner were Mrs. Montagu, Mr. Percy,
      Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, his lady and daughter, and Sir
      Joshua Reynolds and Miss Palmer. I was excessively glad to see the latter,
      who clung to me all the visit, and took off from its formality and
      grandeur by her chatting and intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Walsingham lives in a splendid house in Stratford place, elegantly
      fitted up, chiefly by her own paintings and drawings, which are reckoned
      extremely clever. I hate that word, but cannot think of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not stay late, for my father and I were both engaged to Miss
      Monckton's; so was Sir Joshua, who accompanied us.

    <h2>
      MRS. SIDDONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was extremely happy to have my dear father with me at Miss Monckton's.
      We found Mrs. Siddons, the actress, there. She is a woman of excellent
      character, and therefore I am very glad she is thus patronised, since Mrs.
      Abington, and so many frail fair ones, have been thus noticed by the
      great. She behaved with great propriety; very calm, modest, quiet, and
      unaffected&mdash;-She has a very fine countenance, and her eyes look both
      intelligent and soft. She has, however, a steadiness in her manner and
      deportment by no means engaging. Mrs. Thrale, who was there, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Why,
      this is a leaden goddess we are all worshipping! however, we shall soon
      gild it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lady who sat near me then began a dialogue with Mr. Erskine,<a
      href="#linknote-167" name="linknoteref-167" id="linknoteref-167">[167]</a>
      who had placed himself exactly opposite to Mrs. Siddons; and they debated
      together upon her manner of studying her parts, disputing upon the point
      with great warmth, yet not only forbearing to ask Mrs. Siddons herself
      which was right, but quite over-powering her with their loquacity, when
      she attempted, unasked, to explain the matter. Most vehement praise of all
      she did followed, and the lady turned to me, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What invitation, Miss Burney, is here, for genius to display itself!&mdash;Everybody,
      I hear, is at work for Mrs. Siddons; but if you would work for her, what
      an inducement to excel you would both of you have!&mdash;Dr. Burney&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray, ma'am,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;don't say to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I will!&mdash;if my influence can do you any mischief, you may
      depend upon having it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then repeated what she had said to my father, and he instantly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship may be sure of my interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I whispered afterwards to know who she was, and heard she Was Lady Lucan.

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON'S INMATES AT BOLT-COURT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Tuesday, Dec. 24, I went in the evening to call on Mrs. Thrale, and
      tore myself away from her to go to Bolt-court to see Dr. Johnson, who is
      very unwell. He received me with great kindness, and bade me come oftener,
      which I will try to contrive. He told me he heard of nothing but me, call
      upon him who would; and, though he pretended to growl, he was evidently
      delighted for me. His usual set, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. De Mullins, were
      with him; and some queer man of a parson who, after grinning at me some
      time, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mrs. De Mullins, is the fifth volume of 'Cecilia' at home yet? Dr.
      Johnson made me read it, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, he did it much honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made you, sir?&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you give an ill account of your own
      taste or understanding, if you wanted any making to read such a book as
      'Cecilia.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, I don't mean that; for I am sure I left every thing in the world
      to go on with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shilling was now wanted for some purpose or other, and none of them
      happened to have one; I begged that I might lend one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, do,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I will borrow of you; authors are like
      privateers, always fair game for one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, sir,&rdquo; said the parson, &ldquo;one author is always robbing another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that, sir,&rdquo; cried the doctor; &ldquo;there sits an author who, to
      my knowledge, has robbed nobody. I have never once caught her at a theft.
      The rogue keeps her resources to herself!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE TWO MR. CAMBRIDGES IMPROVE UPON ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
<i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;In the morning Mr. Cambridge<a href="#linknote-168"
       name="linknoteref-168" id="linknoteref-168">[168]</a> came, and made a long
visit. He is entertaining, original, and well-bred; somewhat formal, but
extremely civil and obliging, and, I believe, remarkably honourable and
strict in his principles and actions. I wished I could have been easy
and chatty with him as I hear he is so much my friend, and as I like him
very much; but, in truth, he listens to every syllable I utter with
 so grave a deference, that it intimidates and silences me. When he was
about taking leave, he said,&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you go to Mrs. Ord's<a href="#linknote-169" name="linknoteref-169"
       id="linknoteref-169">[169]</a> to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;and hoped it. Where shall you go
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No where,&mdash;I shall be at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home? Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, Miss Burney, my son<a href="#linknote-170"
       name="linknoteref-170" id="linknoteref-170">[170]</a> and I dine to-day in
      your neighbourhood, at the Archbishop of York's, and, if you please, we
      will come here in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was agreed to. And our evening was really a charming one. The two Mr.
      Cambridges came at about eight o'clock, and the good Mr. Hoole<a
      href="#linknote-171" name="linknoteref-171" id="linknoteref-171">[171]</a>
      was here. My father came downstairs to them in high spirits and good
      humour, and he and the elder Mr. Cambridge not only talked enough for us
      all, but so well and so pleasantly that no person present had even a wish
      to speak for himself. Mr. Cambridge has the best stock of good stories I
      almost ever heard; and, though a little too precise in his manner, he is
      always well-bred, and almost always entertaining. Our sweet father kept up
      the ball with him admirably, whether in anecdotes, serious disquisitions,
      philosophy, or fun; for all which Mr. Cambridge has both talents and
      inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The son rises extremely in my opinion and liking. He is sensible,
      rational, and highly cultivated; very modest in all he asserts, and
      attentive and pleasing in his behaviour; and he is wholly free from the
      coxcombical airs, either of impertinence, or negligence and nonchalance,
      that almost all the young men I meet, except also young Burke, are tainted
      with. What chiefly, however, pleased me in him was observing that he quite
      adores his father. He attended to all his stories with a face that never
      told he had heard them before; and, though he spoke but little himself, he
      seemed as well entertained as if he had been the leading person in the
      company,&mdash;a post which, nevertheless, I believe he could extremely
      well sustain; and, no doubt, much the better for being in no haste to
      aspire to it. I have seldom, altogether, had an evening with which I have
      been better pleased.

    <h2>
      THE SHILLING, THE CHAIRMAN, AND THE GREEN-SHOP GIRL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday, Dec. 28.</i>&mdash;My father and I dined and spent the day at
      Sir Joshua Reynolds's, after many preceding disappointments. I had a
      whispering conversation with Mrs. Reynolds,<a href="#linknote-172"
       name="linknoteref-172" id="linknoteref-172">[172]</a> which made me laugh,
      from her excessive oddness and absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the most unfortunate thing in the world happen to me,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;about Mrs. Montagu, and I always am in some distress or misfortune with
      that lady. She did me the honour to invite me to dine with her last week,&mdash;and
      I am sure there is nobody in the world can be more obliged to Mrs. Montagu
      taking such notice of any body;&mdash;but just when the day came I was so
      unlucky as to be ill, and that, you know, made it quite improper to go to
      dine with Mrs. Montagu, for fear of disagreeable consequences. So this
      vexed me very much, for I had nobody to send to her that was proper to
      appear before Mrs. Montagu; for to own the truth, you must know I have no
      servant but a maid, and I could not think of sending such a person to Mrs.
      Montagu. So I thought it best to send a charman, and to tell him only to
      ring at the bell, and to wait for no answer; because then the porter might
      tell Mrs. Montagu my servant brought the note, for the porter could not
      tell but he might be my servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my maid was so stupid, she took the shilling I gave her for the
      charman, and went to a green-shop, and bid the woman send somebody with
      the note, and she left the shilling with her; so the green-woman, I
      suppose, thought she might keep the shilling, and instead of sending a
      charman she sent her own errand-girl; and she was all dirt and rags. But
      this is not all; for, when the girl got to the house, nothing would serve
      her but she would give the note to Mrs. Montagu, and wait for an answer;
      so then, you know, Mrs. Montagu saw this ragged green-shop girl. I was
      never so shocked in my life, for when she brought me back the note I knew
      at once how it all was. Only think what a mortification, to have Mrs.
      Montagu see such a person as that! She must think it very odd of me indeed
      to send a green-shop girl to such a house as hers!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MR. SOAME JENYNS'S EULOGY ON &ldquo;CECILIA.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, (Jan. 17, 1783.)</i>&mdash;Now for this grand interview with
      Soame Jenyns.<a href="#linknote-173" name="linknoteref-173"
       id="linknoteref-173">[173]</a> I went with my dear father who was quite
      enchanted at the affair. Dear soul, how he feeds upon all that brings fame
      to &ldquo;Cecilia!&rdquo; his eagerness upon this subject, and his pleasure in it, are
      truly enthusiastic, and, I think, rather increase by fulness than grow
      satiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were late; there was a good deal of company, not in groups, nor yet in
      a circle, but seated square round the room, in order following,&mdash;Miss
      Ellerker, Mrs. Soame Jenyns, Mrs. Thrale, her daughter, Mrs. Buller, Mr.
      Cambridge, senior, Mr. Soame Jenyns, Mr. Selwin, Mr. Cambridge, junior,
      Miss Burgoyne, a lady or two I knew not, and three or four men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ord almost ran to the door to receive us, and every creature of this
      company, contrary to all present custom in large meetings, stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you been so late?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Ord, &ldquo;we have been waiting for you
      this hour. I was afraid there was some mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father could not come sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why would not you let me send my coach for you? Mr. Soame Jenyns has
      been dying with impatience; some of us thought you would not come; others
      thought it only coquetry; but come, let us repair the time as we can, and
      introduce you to one another without further delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may believe how happy I felt at this &ldquo;some thought,&rdquo; and &ldquo;others,&rdquo;
       which instantly betrayed that everybody was apprised they were to see this
      famous rencounter; and lest I should mark it less, every body still stood
      up. Mr. Jenyns now, with all the speed in his power, hastened up to me,
      and began a long harangue of which I know hardly a word, upon the pleasure
      and favour, and honour, and what not, of meeting me, and upon the delight,
      and information, and amusement of reading &ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made all possible reverences, and tried to get to a seat, but Mrs. Ord,
      when I turned from him, took my hand, and leading me to the top of the
      room, presented me to Mrs. Jenyns. Reverences were repeated here, in
      silence, however, so they did very well. I then hoped to escape to Mrs.
      Thrale, who held out her hand to me, pointing to a chair by her own, and
      saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I, too, make interest to be introduced to Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was not allowed; Mrs. Ord again took my hand, and parading
      me to the sofa, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Miss Burney, and let me place you by Mrs. Buller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad, by this time, to be placed any where, for not till then did
      the company seat themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cambridge, Sen., then came up to speak to me, but had hardly asked how
      I did before Mrs. Ord brought Mr. Jenyns to me again, and made him my
      right-hand neighbour, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! now I have put you fairly together, I have done with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Soame Jenyns then, thus called upon&mdash;could he do less?&mdash;began
      an eulogy unrivalled, I think, for extravagance of praise. All creation
      was open to me; no human being ever began that book and had power to put
      it down; pathos, humour, interest, moral&mdash;O heavens! I heard,
      however, but the leading words; though every body else, the whole roon,
      being silent, doubtless heard how they hung together. Had I been carried
      to a theatre to hear an oration upon my own performances, I could hardly
      have felt more confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed my head during the first two or three sentences, by way of marking
      that I thought them over; but over they were not the more. I then turned
      away, but I only met Mrs. Buller, who took up the panegyric where Mr.
      Jenyns stopped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the things that were said, with the attention of the whole
      company, would have drawn blushes into the cheeks of Agujari or Garrick. I
      was almost upon the point of running away. I changed so often from hot to
      cold that I really felt myself in a fever and an ague. I never even
      attempted to speak to them, and I looked with all the frigidity I possibly
      could, in hopes they would tire of bestowing such honours on a subject so
      ungrateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment I had hopes that Mr. G. Cambridge, in Christian charity, was
      coming to offer some interruption; for, when these speeches were in their
      height, he came and sat down on a chair immediately opposite Miss Thrale,
      and equally near, in profile, to me; but he merely said, &ldquo;I hope Dr.
      Burney has not wanted his pamphlet?&rdquo; Even Mrs. Thrale would not come near
      me, and told me afterwards it had been such a settled thing before my
      arrival, that I was to belong to Mr. Soame Jenyns, that she did not dare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment they were gone, &ldquo;Well, Miss Burney,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ord, &ldquo;have you
      and Mr. Jenyns had a great deal of conversation together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, a great deal on my part!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you don't look quite recovered from it yet&mdash;did not you like
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, it was perfectly agreeable to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he oppress you?&rdquo; cried Mr. Cambridge, and then he began a very warm
      praise of him for his talents, wit, and understanding, his knowledge,
      writings, and humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should have been very ready to have joined with him, had I not feared he
      meant an implied reproach to me, for not being more grateful for the
      praise of a man such as he described. I am sorry he was present if that is
      the case; but the truth is, the evening was not merely disagreeable but
      painful to me.

    <h2>
      AN ITALIAN SINGER'S VIEWS OF ENGLAND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;While Mr. George Cambridge was here Pacchierotti
      called-very grave, but very sweet. Mr. G. C. asked if he spoke English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, very well,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;pray try him; he is very amiable, and I fancy
      you will like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pacchierotti began with complaining of the variable weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be well such an inconsistent day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We laughed at the word &ldquo;inconsistent,&rdquo; and Mr. Cambridge said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is curious to see what new modes all languages may take in the hands
      of foreigners. The natives dare not try such experiments; and, therefore,
      we all talk pretty much alike; but a foreigner is obliged to hazard new
      expressions, and very often he shews us a force and power in our words, by
      an unusual adaptation of them, that we were not ourselves aware they would
      admit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, to draw Pacchierotti out, he began a dispute, of the different
      merits of Italy and England; defending his own country merely to make him
      abuse it; while Pacchierotti most eagerly took up the gauntlet on the part
      of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a climate,&rdquo; said Pacchierotti, &ldquo;never in the same case for half
      an hour at a time; it shall be fair, and wet, and dry, and humid, forty
      times in a morning in the least. I am tired to be so played with, sir, by
      your climate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have one thing, however, Mr. Pacchierotti,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;which I hope
      you allow makes some amends, and that is our verdure; in Italy you cannot
      boast that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it seem to me, sir, to be of no utility so much evergreen is rather
      too much for my humble opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then your insects, Mr. Pacchierotti! those alone are a most dreadful
      drawback upon the comfort of your fine climate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must own,&rdquo; said Pacchierotti, &ldquo;Italy is rather disagreeable for the
      insects; but is it not better, sir, than an atmosphere so bad as they
      cannot live in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as I can't defend our atmosphere, I must shift my ground, and talk
      to you of our fires, which draw together society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O indeed, good sir, your societies are not very invigorating! Twenty
      people of your gentlemen and ladies to sit about a fire, and not to
      pronounce one word, is very dull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We laughed heartily at this retort courteous.

     [Mary Delany was the daughter of Bernard Granville, younger
     brother of George Granville, Baron Lansdowne, the poet and
     friend of Wycherley and Pope.  She was born on the 14th Of
     May, 1700. Her uncle, Lord Lansdowne, was a better friend to
     the Muses than to his young niece, for he forced poor Mary
     Granville, at the age of seventeen, to marry one Alexander
     Pendarves, a coarse, hard drinking Cornish squire, of more
     than three times her age. Pendarves died some six years
     later, and his widow married, in 1743, Dr. Patrick Delany,
     the friend of Swift.  With Delany she lived happily for
     fifteen years, and after his death in 1768, Mrs. Delany
     devoted most of her time to her bosom friend, the dowager
     Duchess of Portland (see note 161, ante.), at whose
     seat at Bulstrode she usually spent the summer, while during
     the winter she resided at her own house in St. James's-
     place, where she was constantly visited by the Duchess.  On
     the death of the Duchess in July, 1785, King George bestowed
     upon Mrs. Delany, whose means were not such as to make an
     addition to them a matter of indifference, a furnished house
     at Windsor and a pension Of 300 pounds a year.  These she
     enjoyed for less than three years, dying on the 15th of
     April, 1788.

     The strong attachment which grew up between her and Fanny
     renders Mrs. Delany a very interesting figure in the
     &ldquo;Diary.&rdquo;  Nor was Fanny's enthusiasm for her aged friend
     misdirected.  Speaking of Mrs. Delany, Edmund Burke said:
     &ldquo;She was a perfect pattern of a perfect fine lady: a real
     fine lady of other days. Her manners were faultless; her
     deportment was of marked elegance; her speech was all
     sweetness; and her air and address were all dignity.  I have
     always looked up to Mrs. Delany, as the model of an
     accomplished gentlewoman of former times."<a href="#linknote-174"
       name="linknoteref-174" id="linknoteref-174">[174]</a>&mdash;ED.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, January 19</i>&mdash;And now for Mrs. Delany. I spent one hour
      with Mrs. Thrale, and then called for Mrs. Chapone,<a href="#linknote-175"
       name="linknoteref-175" id="linknoteref-175">[175]</a> and we proceeded
      together to St. James's-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany was alone in her drawing-room, which is entirely hung round
      with pictures of her own painting, and Ornaments of her own designing. She
      came to the door to receive us. She is still tall, though some of her
      height may be lost: not much, however, for she is remarkably upright. She
      has no remains of beauty in feature, but in countenance I never but once
      saw more, and that was in my sweet maternal grandmother. Benevolence,
      softness, piety, and gentleness are all resident in her face; and the
      resemblance with which she struck me to my dear grandmother, in her first
      appearance, grew so much stronger from all that came from her mind, which
      seems to contain nothing but purity and native humility, that I almost
      longed to embrace her; and I am sure if I had the recollection of that
      saint-like woman would have been so strong that I should never have
      refrained from crying over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chapone presented me to her, and taking my hand, she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must pardon me if I give you an old-fashioned reception, for I know
      nothing new.&rdquo; And she saluted me. I did not, as with Mrs. Walsingham,
      retreat from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you forgive, Miss Burney,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;this great liberty I have
      taken with you, of asking for your company to dinner? I wished so
      impatiently to see one from whom I have received such extraordinary
      pleasure, that, as I could not be alone this morning, I could not bear to
      put it off to another day; and, if you had been so good to come in the
      evening, I might, perhaps, have had company; and I hear so ill that I
      cannot, as I wish to do, attend to more than one at a time; for age makes
      me stupid even more than I am by nature; and how grieved and mortified I
      must have been to know I had Miss Burney in the room, and not to hear
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then mentioned her regret that we could not stay and spend the evening
      with her, which had been told her in our card of accepting her invitation,
      as we were both engaged, which, for my part, I heartily regretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am particularly sorry,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;on account of the Duchess dowager
      of Portland, who is so good as to come to me in an evening, as she knows I
      am too infirm to wait upon her grace myself: and she wished so much to see
      Miss Burney. But she said she would come as early as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after we went to dinner, which was plain, neat, well cooked, and
      elegantly served. When it was over, I began to speak; and now, my
      Chesington auditors, look to yourselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me leave, ma'am, to ask if you remember any body of the
      name of Crisp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crisp?&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;What! Mrs. Ann Crisp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O surely! extremely well! a charming, an excellent woman she was; we were
      very good friends once; I visited her at Burford, and her sister Mrs.
      Gast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came my turn, and I talked of the brother&mdash;-but I won't write
      what I said. Mrs. Delany said she knew him but very little; and by no
      means so much as she should have liked. I reminded her of a letter he
      wrote her from abroad, which she immediately recollected.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Chesingtonian talk lasted till we went upstairs, and then she shewed
      me the new art which she had invented. It is staining paper of all
      possible colours, and then cutting it out, so finely, and delicately, that
      when it is pasted on paper or vellum, it has all the appearance of being
      pencilled, except that, by being raised, it has still a richer and more
      natural look. The effect is extremely beautiful. She invented it at
      twenty-five! She told me she did four flowers the first year; sixteen the
      second; and the third, one hundred and sixty; and after that many more.
      They are all from nature, and consist of the most curious flowers, plants,
      and weeds, that are to (be found. She has been supplied with patterns from
      all the great gardens, and all the great florists in the kingdom. Her plan
      was to finish one thousand; but, alas! her eyes now fail her though she
      has only twenty undone of her task.
    </p>
    <p>
      About seven o'clock, the Duchess dowager of Portland came. She is not near
      so old as Mrs. Delany; nor, to me, is her face by any means so pleasing;
      but yet there is sweetness, and dignity, and intelligence in it. Mrs.
      Delany received her with the same respectful ceremony as if it was her
      first visit, though she regularly goes to her every evening. But what she
      at first took as an honour and condescension, she has so much of true
      humility of mind, that no use can make her see in any other light. She
      immediately presented me to her. Her grace courtesied and smiled with the
      most flattering air of pleasure, and said she was particularly happy in
      meeting with me. We then took our places, and Mrs. Delany said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, ma'am, is acquainted with Mr. Crisp, whom your grace knew so
      well; and she tells me he and his sister have been so good as to remember
      me, and to mention me to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchess instantly asked me a thousand questions about him&mdash;where
      he lived, how he had his health, and whether his fondness for the polite
      arts still continued. She said he was one of the most ingenious and
      agreeable men she had ever known, and regretted his having sequestered
      himself so much from the society of his former friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this conversation I found the duchess very charming,
      high-bred, courteous, sensible, and spirited; not merely free from pride,
      but free from affability&mdash;its most mortifying deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this she asked me if I had seen Mrs. Siddons, and what I thought of
      her. I answered that I admired her very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Miss Burney approves her,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;no approbation, I am
      sure, can do her so much credit; for no one can so perfectly judge of
      characters or of human nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ma'am,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Delany, archly, &ldquo;and does your grace remember
      protesting you would never read 'Cecilia?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, laughing, &ldquo;I declared that five volumes could never be
      attacked; but since I began I have read it three times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O terrible!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;to make them out fifteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;I held out so long against reading them, was
      remembering the cry there was in favour of 'Clarissa' and 'Sir Charles
      Grandison,' when they came out, and those I never could read. I was teased
      into trying both of them; but I was disgusted with their tediousness, and
      could not read eleven letters, with all the effort I could make: so much
      about my sisters and my brothers, and all my uncles and my aunts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if your grace had gone on with 'Clarissa,'&rdquo; said Mrs. Chapone, &ldquo;the
      latter part must certainly have affected you, and charmed you."<a
      href="#linknote-176" name="linknoteref-176" id="linknoteref-176">[176]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I hate any thing so dismal! Every body that did read it had melancholy
      faces for a week. 'Cecilia' is as pathetic as I can bear, and more
      sometimes; yet, in the midst of the sorrow, there is a spirit in the
      writing, a fire in the whole composition, that keep off that heavy
      depression given by Richardson. Cry, to be sure, we did. Mrs. Delany,
      shall you ever forget how we cried? But then we had so much laughter to
      make us amends, we were never left to sink under our concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am really ashamed to write on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chapone, &ldquo;when I first read it, I did not cry at
      all; I was in an agitation that half killed me, that shook all nerves, and
      made me unable to sleep at nights, from the suspense I was in! but I could
      not cry, for excess of eagerness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;Miss Burney could have been in some
      corner, amusing herself with listening to us, when Lord Weymouth, and the
      Bishop of Exeter, and Mr. Lightfoot, and Mrs. Delany, and I, were all
      discussing the point&mdash;of the name. So earnest we were, she must have
      been diverted with us. Nothing, the nearest our own hearts and interests,
      could have been debated more warmly. The bishop was quite as eager as any
      of us; but what cooled us a little, at last, was Mr. Lightfoot's thinking
      we were seriously going to quarrel; and while Mrs. Delany and I were
      disputing about Mrs. Delvile, he very gravely said, 'Why, ladies, this is
      only a matter of imagination; it is not a fact: don't be so earnest.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ma'am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;how hard your grace was upon Mrs. Delvile:
      so elegant, so sensible, so judicious, so charming a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I hate her,&rdquo; cried the duchess, &ldquo;resisting that sweet Cecilia; coaxing
      her, too, all the time, with such hypocritical flattery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget,&rdquo; said Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;your grace's earnestness when
      we came to that part where Mrs. Delvile bursts a blood vessel. Down
      dropped the book, and just with the same energy as if your grace had heard
      some real and important news, You called out, 'I'm glad of it with all my
      heart!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What disputes, too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chapone, &ldquo;there are about Briggs. I was in
      a room some time ago where somebody said there could be no such character;
      and a poor little mean city man, who was there, started up and said, 'But
      there is though, for I've one myself!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Harrels!&mdash;O, then the Harrels!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Delany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you speak of the Harrels, and of the morality of the book,&rdquo; cried the
      duchess, with a solemn sort of voice, &ldquo;we shall, indeed, never give Miss
      Burney her due: so striking, so pure, so genuine, so instructive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Chapone, &ldquo;let us complain how we will of the torture she
      has given our nerves, we must all join in saying she has bettered us by
      every line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No book,&rdquo; said Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;ever was so useful as this, because none
      other that is so good was ever so much read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think I need now write no more. I could, indeed, hear no more; for this
      last so serious praise, from characters so respectable, so moral, and so
      aged, quite affected me; and though I had wished a thousand times during
      the discourse to run out of the room, when they gave me finally this
      solemn sanction to the meaning and intention of my writing, I found it not
      without difficulty that I could keep the tears out of my eyes; and when I
      told what had passed to our sweet father, his cup quite ran over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchess had the good sense and judgment to feel she had drawn up her
      panegyric to a climax, and therefore here she stopped; so, however, did
      not we, for our coach was ready.

      FANNY BURNEY to MR. CRISP
    </h2>
    <h3>
      April 12, 1783.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My dearest&mdash;dearest daddy,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am more grieved at the long and most disappointing continuation of your
      illness than I know how to tell <i>you</i>; and though my last account, I
      thank heaven, is better, I find you still suffer so much, that my
      congratulations in my letter to Susan, upon what I thought your recovery,
      must have appeared quite crazy, if you did not know me as well as you do,
      and were not sure what affliction the discovery of my mistake would bring
      to myself. I think I never yet so much wished to be at Chesington, as at
      this time, that I might see how you go on, and not be kept in such painful
      suspense from post to post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did you tell me of the Deladys, Portlands, Cambridges, etc., as if any
      of them came into competition with yourself? When you are better, I shall
      send you a most fierce and sharp remonstrance upon this subject. At
      present I must be content with saying, I will undoubtedly accept your most
      kind invitation as soon as I possibly can. Meantime, if my letters will
      give you any amusement, I will write oftener than ever, and supply you
      with all the prog I get myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan, who is my reader, must be your writer, and let me know if such
      tittle-tattle as I can collect serves to divert some of those many moments
      of languor and weariness that creep between pain and ease, and that call
      more for mental food than for bodily medicine. Your love to your Fannikin,
      I well know, makes all trash interesting to you that seems to concern her;
      and I have no greater pleasure, when absent, than in letting you and my
      dear Susan be acquainted with my proceedings. I don't mean by this to
      exclude the rest of the dear Chesington set&mdash;far from it&mdash;but a
      sister and a daddy must come first.
    </p>
    <p>
      God bless and restore you, my most dear daddy! You know not how kindly I
      take your thinking of me, and inquiring about me, in an illness that might
      so well make you forget us all; but Susan assures me your heart is as
      affectionate as ever to your ever and ever faithful and loving child, F.
      B.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Mr. Crisp's illness became so alarming, that Miss Burney
     hastened to Chesington, where she had been only a few days
     when her valued friend breathed his last.  In reply to a
     letter, in which she had given Dr. Burney an account of Mr.
     Crisp's increasing sufferings, the doctor wrote:

     &ldquo;Ah! my dear Fanny, your last letter has broke all our
     hearts! your former accounts kept off despair; but this
     brings it back in all its horrors.  I wish, if it were
     possible, that you would let him know how much I loved him,
     and how heavily I shall feel his loss when all this hurry
     subsides, and lets me have time to brood over my sorrows.  I
     have always thought that, in many particulars, his equal was
     not to be found.  His wit, learning, taste, penetration,
     and, when well, his conviviality, pleasantry, and kindness
     of heart to me and mine, will ever be thought of with the
     most profound and desponding regret.&rdquo;

     After the last mournful duties had been performed at
     Chesington,<a href="#linknote-177" name="linknoteref-177"
       id="linknoteref-177">[177]</a> Miss Burney returned to her father's house

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON ATTACKED BY PARALYSIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday, June 19.</i>&mdash;We heard to-day that Dr. Johnson had been
      taken ill, in a way that gave a dreadful shock to himself, and a most
      anxious alarm to his friends. Mr. Seward brought the news here, and my
      father and I instantly went to his house. He had earnestly desired me,
      when we lived so much together at Streatham, to see him frequently if he
      should be ill. He saw my father, but he had medical people with him, and
      could not admit me upstairs, but he sent me down a most kind message, that
      he thanked me for calling, and when he was better should hope to see me
      often. I had the satisfaction to hear from Mrs. Williams that the
      physicians had pronounced him to be in no danger, and expected a speedy
      recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stroke was confined to his tongue. Mrs. Williams told me a most
      striking and touching circumstance that attended the attack. It was at
      about four o'clock in the morning: he found himself with a paralytic
      affection; he rose, and composed in his own mind a Latin prayer to the
      Almighty, &ldquo;that whatever were the sufferings for which he must prepare
      himself, it would please Him, through the grace and mediation of our
      blessed Saviour, to spare his intellects, and let them all fall upon his
      body.&rdquo; When he had composed this, internally, he endeavoured to speak it
      aloud, but found his voice was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>June 20.</i>&mdash;I Went in the morning to Dr. Johnson, and heard a
      good account of him. Dr. Rose, Dr. Dunbar, and Sam Rose, the Doctor's son,
      dined with us. We expected the rest of our party early though the absence
      of Dr. Johnson, whom they were all invited to meet, took off the spirit of
      the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>July 1.</i>&mdash;I had the satisfaction to hear from Sir Joshua that
      Dr. Johnson had dined with him at the Club. I look upon him, therefore,
      now, as quite recovered. I called the next morning to congratulate him,
      and found him very gay and very good-humoured.

    <h2>
      A PLEASANT DAY WITH THE CAMBRIDGES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>July 15.</i>&mdash;To-day my father, my mother, and I, went by
      appointment to dine and spend the day at Twickenham with the Cambridges.
      Soon after our arrival Mr. C. asked if we should like to walk, to which we
      most readily agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not strolled far before we were followed by Mr. George. No sooner
      did his father perceive him, than, hastily coming up to my side, he began
      a separate conversation with me; and leaving his son the charge of all the
      rest, he made me walk off with him from them all. It was really a droll
      manoeuvre, but he seemed to enjoy it highly, and though he said not a word
      of his design, I am sure it reminded me of his own old trick to his son,
      when listening to a dull story, in saying to the relator,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell the
      rest of that to George.&rdquo; And if George was in as good-humour with his
      party as his father was with his why, all were well pleased. As soon as we
      had fairly got away from them, Mr. Cambridge, with the kindest smiles of
      satisfaction, said,&mdash;&ldquo;I give you my word I never was more pleased at
      any thing in my life than I am now at having you here to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I had felt so glad at seeing him again, after so long an
      absence, that I had really half a mind to have made up to him myself, and
      shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot imagine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how you flatter me!&mdash;and there is
      nothing, I do assure you, of which I am prouder, than seeing you have got
      the better of your fear of me, and feeling that I am not afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me, sir?&mdash;but how should you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I give you my word, if I was not conscious of the greatest purity of
      mind, I should more fear you than any body in the world. You know
      everything, everybody,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;so wonderfully well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We then, I know not how, fell into discussing the characters of forward
      and flippant women; and I told him it was my fortune to be, in general, a
      very great favourite with them, though I felt so little gratitude for that
      honour, that the smallest discernment would show them it was all thrown
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is very difficult,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for a woman to get rid of those
      forward characters without making them her enemies. But with a man it is
      different. Now I have a very peculiar happiness, which I will tell you. I
      never took very much to a very amiable woman but I found she took also to
      me, and I have the good fortune to be in the perfect confidence of some of
      the first women in this kingdom; but then there are a great many women
      that I dislike, and think very impertinent and foolish, and, do you know,
      they all dislike me too!&mdash;they absolutely cannot bear me! Now, I
      don't know, of those two things, which is the greatest happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How characteristic this!&mdash;do you not hear him saying it?
    </p>
    <p>
      We now renewed our conversation upon various of our acquaintances,
      particularly Mr. Pepys, Mr. Langton, and Mrs. Montagu. We stayed in this
      field, sitting and sauntering, near an hour. We then went to a stile, just
      by the riverside, where the prospect is very beautiful, and there we
      seated ourselves. Nothing could be more pleasant, though the wind was so
      high I was almost blown into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now traced to me great part of his life and conduct in former times,
      and told me a thousand excellent anecdotes of himself and his associates.
      He summed them all up in a way that gave me equal esteem and regard for
      him, in saying he found society the only thing for lasting happiness;
      that, if he had not met a woman he could permanently love, he must with
      every other advantage have been miserable&mdash;but that such was his good
      fortune, that &ldquo;to and at this moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no sight so
      pleasing to me as seeing Mrs. Cambridge enter a room; and that after
      having been married to her for forty years. And the next most pleasing
      sight to me is an amiable woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then assured me that almost all the felicity of his life both had
      consisted, and did still consist, in female society. It was, indeed, he
      said, very rare but there was nothing like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if agreeable women,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;are rare, much more so, I think, are
      agreeable men; at least, among my acquaintance they are very few, indeed,
      that are highly agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and when they are so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is difficult for you to have
      their society with any intimacy or comfort; there are always so many
      reasons why you cannot know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We continued chatting until we came to the end of the meadow, and there we
      stopped, and again were joined by the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cambridge now proposed the water, to which I eagerly agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had an exceeding pleasant excursion. We went up the river beyond the
      Duke of Montagu's, and the water was smooth and delightful. Methinks I
      should like much to sail from the very source to the mouth of the
      Thames....
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner we again repaired to the lawn, in a general body; but&mdash;we&mdash;had
      scarce moved ten paces, before Mr. Cambridge again walked off with me, to
      a seat that had a very fine view of Petersham wood, and there we renewed
      our confabulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now shewed me a note from Mr. Gibbon, sent to engage himself to
      Twickenham on the unfortunate day he got his ducking.<a
      href="#linknote-178" name="linknoteref-178" id="linknoteref-178">[178]</a>
      It is the most affected little piece of writing I ever saw. He shall
      attend him, he says, at Twickenham, and upon the water, as soon as the
      weather is propitious, and the Thames, that amiable creature, is ready, to
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, to be sure, could be so apt as such a reception as that &ldquo;amiable
      creature&rdquo; happened to give him! Mr. Cambridge said it was &ldquo;God's revenge
      against conceit.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON's HEROIC FORBEARANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday, December 9</i>&mdash;This evening at Mrs. Vesey's, Mr. George
      Cambridge came, and took the chair half beside me. I told him of some new
      members for Dr. Johnson's club!<a href="#linknote-179"
       name="linknoteref-179" id="linknoteref-179">[179]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it sounds more like some club that one reads of in
      the 'Spectator,' than like a real club in these times; for the forfeits of
      a whole year will not amount to those of a single night in other clubs.
      Does Pepys belong to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! he is quite of another party! He is head man on the side of the
      defenders of Lord Lyttelton. Besides, he has had enough of Dr. Johnson;
      for they had a grand battle upon the 'Life of Lyttelton,' at Streatham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had they really a serious quarrel? I never imagined it had amounted
      to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, serious enough, I assure you. I never saw Dr. Johnson really in a
      passion but then: and dreadful, indeed, it was to see. I wished myself
      away a thousand times. It was a frightful scene. He so red, poor Mr. Pepys
      so pale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did it begin? What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Johnson came to the point without much ceremony. He called out
      aloud, before a large company, at dinner, 'What have you to say, sir, to
      me or of me? Come forth, man! I hear you object to my &ldquo;Life of Lord
      Lyttelton. What are your objections? If you have anything to say, let's
      hear it. Come forth, man, when I call you!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a call, indeed! Why, then, he fairly bullied him into a quarrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I was the more sorry, because Mr. Pepys had begged of me, before
      they met, not to let Lord Lyttelton be mentioned. Now I had no more power
      to prevent it than this macaroon cake in my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was behaving ill to Mrs. Thrale, certainly, to quarrel in her house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he never repeated it; though he wished of all things to have
      gone through just such another scene with Mrs. Montagu, and to refrain was
      an act of heroic forbearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I rather wonder he did not; for she was the head of the set of
      Lytteltonians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he knows that; he calls Mr. Pepys only her prime minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does he call her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queen,' to be sure! 'Queen of the blues.' She came to Streatham one
      morning, and I saw he was dying to attack her. But he had made a promise
      to Mrs. Thrale to have no more quarrels in her house, and so he forced
      himself to forbear. Indeed he was very much concerned, when it was over,
      for what had passed; and very candid and generous in acknowledging it. He
      is too noble to adhere to wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did Mrs. Montagu herself behave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very stately, indeed, at first. She turned from him very stiffly, and
      with a most distant air, and without even courteseying to him, and with a
      firm intention to keep to what she had publicly declared&mdash;that she
      would never speak to him more! However, he went up to her himself, longing
      to begin! and very roughly said,&mdash;'Well, madam, what's become of your
      fine new house? I hear no more of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did she bear this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why she was obliged to answer him; and she soon grew so frightened&mdash;as
      everybody else does&mdash;that she was as civil as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed heartily at this account. But I told him Dr. Johnson was now
      much softened. He had acquainted me, when I saw him last, that he had
      written to her upon the death of Mrs. Williams, because she had allowed
      her something yearly, which now ceased. 'And I had a very kind answer from
      her,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well then, sir,' cried I, 'I hope peace now will be again proclaimed.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, I am now,' said he, 'come to that time when I wish all bitterness
      and animosity to be at an end. I have never done her any serious harm&mdash;nor
      would I; though I could give her a bite!&mdash;but she must provoke me
      much first. In volatile talk, indeed, I may have spoken of her not much to
      her mind; for in the tumult of conversation malice is apt to grow
      sprightly! and there, I hope, I am not yet decrepid!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He quite laughed aloud at this characteristic speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I most readily assured the doctor that I had never yet seen him limp.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;SWEET BEWITCHING MRS. LOCKE.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, April 23, 1784.</i>&mdash;The sweet and most bewitching Mrs.
      Locke called upon me in the evening, with her son George. I let her in and
      did so rejoice I had not gone to Mrs. Vesey's. But I rejoiced for only a
      short time; she came but to take leave, for she was going to Norbury the
      very next morning. I was quite heavy all the evening. She does truly
      interest both head and heart. I love her already. And she was so kind, so
      caressing, so soft; pressed me so much to fix a time for going to Norbury;
      said such sweet things of Mrs. Phillips; and kissed me so affectionately
      in quitting me, that I was quite melted by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a charm has London lost for me by her departure sweet creature that
      she is; born and bred to dispense pleasure and delight to all who see or
      know her! She, Mrs. Thrale and Mrs. Delany, in their several ways all
      excellent, possess the joint powers of winning the affections, while they
      delight the intellects, to the highest summit I can even conceive of human
      attraction. The heart-fascination of Mrs. Thrale, indeed, few know&mdash;-but
      those few must confess and must feel her sweetness, to them, is as
      captivating as her wit is brilliant to all.

    <p>
      <i>Tuesday night, May 1784.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am come, dearest Burney. It is neither dream nor fiction, though I love
      you dearly, or I would not have come. Absence and distance do nothing
      towards wearing out real affection so you shall always find it in your
      true and tender H. L. T.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am somewhat shaken bodily, but 'tis the mental shocks that have made me
      unable to bear the corporeal ones. 'Tis past ten o'clock, however, and I
      must lay myself down with the sweet expectation of seeing my charming
      friend in the morning to breakfast. I love Dr. Burney too well to fear
      him, and he loves me too well to say a word which should make me love him
      less.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>May 17.</i>&mdash;Let me now, my Susy, acquaint you a little more
      connectedly than I have done of late how I have gone on. The rest of that
      week I devoted almost wholly to sweet Mrs. Thrale, whose society was truly
      the most delightful of cordials to me, however, at times, mixed with
      bitters the least palatable. Were I not sensible of her goodness, and full
      of incurable affection for her, should I not be a monster?...
    </p>
    <p>
      I parted most reluctantly with my dear Mrs. Thrale, whom, when or how I
      shall see again heaven only knows! but in sorrow we parted&mdash;on my
      side in real affliction.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Towards the end of July in this year, Mrs. Thrale's second
     marriage took place with Mr. Piozzi, and Miss Burney went
     about the same time to Norbury Park, where she passed some
     weeks with Mr and Mrs. Locke.  The following &ldquo;sketch&rdquo; of a
     letter, and memorandum of what had recently passed between
     Mrs. Piozzi and herself, is from the journal of that
     period.]

    <p>
      When my wondering eyes first looked over the letter I received last night,
      my mind instantly dictated a high-spirited vindication of the consistency,
      integrity, and faithfulness of the friendship thus abruptly reproached and
      cast away. But a sleepless night gave me leisure to recollect that you
      were ever as generous as precipitate, and that your own heart would do
      justice to mine, in the cooler judgment of future reflection. Committing
      myself, therefore, to that period, I determined Simply to assure you, that
      if my last letter hurt either you or Mr. Piozzi, I am no less sorry than
      surprised; and that if it offended you, I sincerely beg your pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to that time, however, can I wait to acknowledge the pain an
      accusation so unexpected has caused me, nor the heartfelt satisfaction
      with which I shall receive, when you are able to write it, a softer

     uniformly, openly, and with deep and avowed affliction,
     thought wrong.

      Give yourself no serious concern, sweetest Burney. All is well, and I am

      A HAPPY HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, Oct. 8.</i>&mdash;I set off with my dear father for Chesington,
      where we passed five days very comfortably; my father was all good humour,
      all himself,&mdash;such as you and I mean by that word. The next day we
      had the blessing of your Dover letter<a href="#linknote-180"
       name="linknoteref-180" id="linknoteref-180">[180]</a> and on Thursday,
      Oct.:14, I arrived at dear Norbury Park at about seven o'clock, after a
      pleasant ride in the dark. Locke most kindly and cordially welcomed me; he
      came out upon the steps to receive me, and his beloved Fredy<a
      href="#linknote-181" name="linknoteref-181" id="linknoteref-181">[181]</a>
      waited for me in the vestibule. Oh, with what tenderness did she take me
      to her bosom! I felt melted with her kindness, but I could not express a
      joy like hers, for my heart was very full of my dearest Susan, whose image
      seemed before me upon the spot where we had so lately been together. They
      told me that Madame de la Fite, her daughter, and Mr. Hinde, were in the
      house; but as I am now, I hope, come for a long time, I did not vex at
      hearing this. Their first inquiries were if I had not heard from Boulogne.<a
      href="#linknote-182" name="linknoteref-182" id="linknoteref-182">[182]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I fully expected a letter, but none came; but
      Sunday I depended upon one. The post, however, did not arrive before we
      went to church. Madame de la Fite, seeing my sorrowful looks, good
      naturedly asked Mrs. Locke what could be set about to divert a little la
      pauvre Mademoiselle Beurney? and proposed reading a drama of Madame de
      Genlis. I approved it much, preferring it greatly to conversation and
      accordingly, she and her daughter, each taking characters to themselves,
      read &ldquo;La Rosire de Salency.&rdquo; It is a very interesting and touchingly
      simple little drama. I was so much pleased that they afterwards regularly
      read one every evening while they stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I went up stairs as usual, to treat myself with a solo of
      impatience for the post, and at about twelve o'clock I heard Mrs. Locke
      stepping along the passage. I was sure of good news, for I knew, if there
      was bad, poor Mr. Locke would have brought it. She came in, with three
      letters in her hand, and three thousand dimples in her cheeks and chin!
      Oh, my dear Susy, what a sight to me was your hand! I hardly cared for the
      letter; I hardly desired to open it; the direction alone almost satisfied
      me sufficiently. How did Mrs. Locke embrace me! I half kissed her to
      death. O Then came dear Mr. Locke, his eyes brighter than ever&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
      how does she do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question forced me to open my letter; all was just as I could wish,
      except that I regretted the having written the day before such a
      lamentation. I was so congratulated! I shook hands with Mr. Locke; the two
      dear little girls came jumping to wish me joy and Mrs. Locke ordered a
      fiddler, that they might have a dance in the evening, which had been
      promised them from the time of Mademoiselle de la Fite's arrival, but
      postponed from day to day, by general desire, on account of my uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, Oct. 25</i>&mdash;Mr. Hinde and Madame and Mademoiselle de la
      Fite all left us. They were all so good humoured and so happy, there was
      no being glad; though how to be sorry at remaining alone with this family,
      I really know not. Both the De la Fites went away in tears. I love them
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday, Nov. 3</i>&mdash;This day has brought ine another sweet
      letter from my Susy. What a set of broken-fortuned, broken-charactered
      people of fashion are about you at Boulogne.<a href="#linknote-183"
       name="linknoteref-183" id="linknoteref-183">[183]</a> The accounts are at
      once curious and melancholy to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more truly pleasant than our present lives. I bury all
      disquietudes in immediate enjoyment; an enjoyment more fitted to my secret
      mind than any I had ever hoped to attain. We are so perfectly tranquil,
      that not a particle of our whole frames seems ruffled or discomposed., Mr.
      Locke is gayer and more sportive than I ever have seen him; his Freddy
      seems made up of happiness; and the two dear little girls are in spirits
      almost ecstatic; and all from that internal contentment which Norbury Park
      seems to have gathered from all corners of the world into its own sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mornings, if fine, are to ourselves, as Mr. Locke rides out; if bad,
      we assemble in the picture room. We have two books in public reading:
      Madame de Sevigne's &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; and Cook's last &ldquo;Voyage.&rdquo; Mrs. Locke reads
      the French, myself the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conversations, too, are such as I could almost wish to last for ever.
      Mr. Locke has been all himself,&mdash;all instruction, information, and
      intelligence,&mdash;since we have been left alone; and the invariable
      sweetness, as well as judgment, of all he says, leaves, indeed, nothing to
      wish. They will not let me go while I can stay, and I am now most willing
      to stay till I must go. The serenity of a life like this, smoothes the
      whole internal surface of the mind. My own I assure you, begins to feel
      quite glossy. To see Mrs. Locke so entirely restored to total health, and
      to see her adoring husband lose all his torturing Solicitude, while he
      retains his Unparalleled tenderness-these are sights to anticipate a taste
      of paradise, if paradise has any felicity consonant to our now ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday, Nov. 9.</i>&mdash;This is Mr. William Locke's birthday; he is
      now seventeen. He came home, with his brothers, to keep it, three days
      ago. May they all be as long-lived and as happy as they are now sweet and
      amiable! This sweet place is beautiful even yet, though no longer of a
      beauty young and blooming, such as you left it; but the character Of the
      prospect is so 'grand that winter cannot annihilate its charms, though it
      greatly diminishes them. The variety of the grounds, and the striking form
      of the hills, always afford something new to observe, and contain
      something lasting to admire. Were I, however, in a desert, people such as
      these would make it gay and cheery.

      FANNY BURNEY TO MRS. LOCKE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      St. Martin's St.,
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nov. 14.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... I had a very unpleasant morning after I left you. When the coach and I
      had waited upon my father, I made the visit I mentioned to you. O what a
      visit!&mdash;all that I pre-supposed of attack, inquiry, and acrimony, was
      nothing to what passed. Rage more intemperate I have not often seen; and
      the shrill voice of feeble old age, screaming with unavailing passion is
      horrible. She had long looked upon Mrs. Thrale as a kind of protege, whom
      she had fondled as a child, and whose fame, as she grew into notice, she
      was always proud to hear of, and help to exalt. She is a woman (I can well
      attest!) of most furious passions herself, however at liberty she thinks
      she may be to show no sort of mercy to those of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, had I been less disturbed, I could have laughed; for she declared
      with great vehemence, that if she had suspected &ldquo;the wretch of any
      intention to marry the man, she would have ordered her own postchaise, and
      followed her to prevent it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas, poor Lady F.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then called upon me, to hear my story; which, most painfully to
      myself, I related. She expressed herself very sorry for me, till I came to
      an avowal of my letter after the marriage she then flew out into new
      choler. &ldquo;I am amazed you would write to her, Miss Burney! I wonder you
      could think of it any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her, I had thought myself so much indebted to her patience with my
      opposition to all her views and wishes for the whole tine of her long
      conflict, that, although I was the first to acknowledge her last action
      indefensible, I should be the last to forget all that had made me love her
      before it was committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This by no means satisfied her, and she poured forth again a torrent of
      unrelenting abuse. Some company, at last, came in, and I hastily took my
      leave. She called after me to fix some day for a longer visit; but I
      pretended not to hear, and ran down stairs, heartily resolving that
      necessity alone should ever force me into her presence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came home&mdash;before I could get upstairs&mdash;I was summoned to
      Miss Streatfield, whom I met with as little pleasure as Lady F., since I
      had never seen her, nor indeed anybody, from the time this cruel
      transaction has been published. Not that I dreaded her violence, for she
      is as gentle as a lamb but there were causes enough for dread of another
      nature. However fortunately and unexpectedly, she never named the subject,
      but prattled away upon nothing but her own affairs; and so, methinks, have
      I done too, and just as if I knew you wished to hear them. Do you?&mdash;I
      ask only for decency's sake.

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON'S FAILING HEALTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Norbury Park, Sunday, Nov. 28.</i>&mdash;Last Thursday, my father set
      me down at Bolt-court, while he went on upon business. I was anxious to
      again see poor Dr. Johnson, who has had terrible health since his return
      from Lichfield. He let me in, though very ill. He was alone, which I much
      rejoiced at; for I had a longer and more satisfactory conversation with
      him than I have had for many months. He was in rather better spirits, too,
      than I had lately seen him, but he told me he was going to try what
      sleeping out of town might do for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that my wife, when she was near her end, poor
      woman, was also advised to sleep out of town, and when she was carried to
      the lodgings that had been prepared for her, she complained that the
      staircase was in very bad condition&mdash;for the plaster was beaten off
      the wall in many places. 'Oh,' said the man of the house, 'that's nothing
      but by the knocks against it of the coffins of the poor souls that have
      died in the lodgings.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, though not without apparent secret anguish, in telling me
      this. I felt extremely shocked, but, willing to confine my words at least
      to the literal story, I only exclaimed against the unfeeling absurdity of
      such a confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a confession,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;to a person then coming to try his
      lodgings for her health, contains, indeed, more absurdity than we can well
      lay our account for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had seen Miss Thrale the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then said,&mdash;&ldquo;Do you ever, sir, hear from her mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;nor write to her. I drive her quite from my mind. If I
      meet with one of her letters, I burn it instantly. I have burnt all I can
      find. I never speak of her, and I desire never to hear of her more. I
      drive her, as I said, wholly from my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet, wholly to change this discourse, I gave him a history of the Bristol
      milk-woman, and told him the tales I had heard of her writing so
      wonderfully, though she had read nothing but Young and Milton &ldquo;though
      those,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;could never possibly, I should think, be the first
      authors with anybody. Would children understand them? and grown people who
      have not read are children in literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but there is nothing so little comprehended among
      mankind as what is genius. They give to it all, when it can be but a part.
      Genius is nothing more than knowing the use of tools&mdash;but there must
      be tools for it to use: a man who has spent all his life in this room will
      give a very poor account of what is contained in the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir; yet there is such a thing as invention. Shakspeare could
      never have seen a Caliban.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he had seen a man, and knew, therefore, how to vary him to a
      monster. A man who would draw a monstrous cow, must first know what a cow
      commonly is; or how can he tell that to give her an ass's head or an
      elephant's tusk will make her monstrous. Suppose you show me a man who is
      a very expert carpenter; another will say he was born to be a carpenter&mdash;but
      what if he had never seen any wood? Let two men, one with genius, the
      other with none, look at an overturned waggon; he who has no genius, will
      think of the waggon only as he sees it, overturned, and walk on; he who
      has genius, will paint it to himself before it was overturned&mdash;standing
      still, and moving on, and heavy loaded, and empty; but both must see the
      waggon, to think of it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then animated, and talked on, upon this milk-woman, upon a once as
      famous shoemaker, and upon our immortal Shakspeare, with as much fire,
      spirit, wit, and truth of criticism and judgment, as ever yet I have heard
      him. How delightfully bright are his faculties, though the poor and infirm
      machine that contains them seems alarmingly giving way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, all brilliant as he was, I saw him growing worse, and offered to go,
      which, for the first time I ever remember, he did not oppose; but, most
      kindly pressing both my hands,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not,&rdquo; he said, in a voice of even tenderness, &ldquo;be not longer in coming
      again for my letting you go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured him I would be the sooner, and was running off, but he called me
      back, in a solemn voice, and, in a manner the most energetic, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember me in your prayers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I longed to ask him to remember me, but did not dare. I gave him my
      promise, and, very heavily indeed, I left him. Great, good, and excellent
      that he is, how short a time will he be our boast! Ah, my dear Susy, I see
      he is going! This winter will never conduct him to a more genial season
      here! Elsewhere, who shall hope a fairer? I wish I had bid him pray for
      me, but it seemed to me presumptuous.

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON DYING. HIS DEATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday, Dec. 8.</i>&mdash;At night my father brought us the most
      dismal tidings of dear Dr. Johnson. Dr. Warren had seen him, and told him
      to take what opium he pleased! He had thanked and taken leave of all his
      physicians. Alas!&mdash;I shall lose him, and he will take no leave of me!<a
      href="#linknote-184" name="linknoteref-184" id="linknoteref-184">[184]</a>
      My father was deeply depressed; he has himself tried in vain for admission
      this week. Yet some people see him&mdash;the Hooles, Mr. Sastres, Mr.
      Langton;&mdash;but then they must be in the house, watching for one
      moment, whole hours. I hear from every one he is now perfectly resigned to
      his approaching fate, and no longer in terror of death. I am thankfully
      happy in hearing that he speaks himself now of the change his mind has
      undergone, from its dark horror&mdash;and says&mdash;&ldquo;He feels the
      irradiation of hope,&rdquo; Good, and pious, and excellent Christian&mdash;who
      shall feel it if not he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dec. 11.</i>&mdash;We had a party to dinner, by long appointment, for
      which, indeed, none of us were well disposed, the apprehension of hearing
      news only of death being hard upon us all. The party was, Dr. Rose, Dr.
      Gillies, Dr. Garthshore, and Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day could not be well&mdash;but mark the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, in the morning, saw this first of men! I had not his account
      till bed-time; he feared over-exciting me. He would not, he said, but have
      seen him for worlds! He happened to be better, and admitted him. He was
      up, and very composed. He took his hand very kindly, asked after all his
      family, and then, in particular, how Fanny did? &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Fanny
      did not take it amiss that I did not see her? I was very bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amiss!&mdash;what a Word! Oh that I had been present to have answered it!
      My father stayed, I suppose, half an hour, and then was coming away. He
      again took his hand, and encouraged him to come again to him; and when he
      was taking leave, said&mdash;&ldquo;Tell Fanny to pray for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! dear Dr. Johnson! might I but have your prayers! After which, still
      grasping his hand, he made a prayer for himself,&mdash;the most fervent,
      pious, humble, eloquent, and touching, my father says, that ever was
      composed. Oh, would I had heard it! He ended it with Amen! in which my
      father joined, and was echoed by all present. And again, when my father
      was leaving him, he brightened up, something of his arch look returned,
      and he said&mdash;&ldquo;I think I shall throw the ball at Fanny yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little more passed ere my father came away, decided, most tenderly, not to
      tell me this till our party was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      This most earnestly increased my desire to see him; this kind and frequent
      mention of me melted me into double sorrow and regret. I would give the
      world I had but gone to him that day! It was, however, impossible, and the
      day was over before I knew he had said what I look upon as a call to me.
      This morning,<a href="#linknote-185" name="linknoteref-185"
       id="linknoteref-185">[185]</a> after church time, I went. Frank<a
      href="#linknote-186" name="linknoteref-186" id="linknoteref-186">[186]</a>
      said he was very ill, and saw nobody; I told him I had understood by my
      father the day before that he meant to see me. He then let me in. I went
      into his room up stairs; he was in his bedroom. I saw it crowded, and ran
      hastily down. Frank told me his master had refused seeing even Mr.
      Langton. I told him merely to say I had called, but by no means to press
      my admission. His own feelings were all that should be consulted; his
      tenderness, I knew, would be equal, whether he was able to see me or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into the parlour, preferring being alone in the cold, to any
      company with a fire. Here I waited long, here and upon the stairs, which I
      ascended and descended to meet again with Frank, and make inquiries; but I
      met him not. At last, upon Dr. Johnson's ringing his bell, I saw Frank
      enter his room, and Mr. Langton follow. &ldquo;Who's that?&rdquo; I heard him say;
      they answered, &ldquo;Mr. Langton,&rdquo; and I found he did not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, all the rest went away but a Mrs. Davis, a good sort of woman,
      whom this truly charitable soul had sent for to take a dinner at his
      house. I then went and waited with her by the fire; it was, however,
      between three and four o'clock before I got any answer. Mr. Langton then
      came himself. He could not look at me, and I turned away from him. Mrs.
      Davis asked how the doctor was? &ldquo;Going on to death very fast!&rdquo; was his
      mournful answer. &ldquo;Has he taken,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;anything?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing at all! We
      carried him some bread and milk&mdash;he refused it, and said&mdash;'The
      less the better.'&rdquo; She asked more questions, by which I found his
      faculties were perfect, his mind composed, and his dissolution was quick
      drawing on....
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not immediately go on, and it is now long since I have written at
      all; but I will go back to this afflicting theme, which I can now better
      bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Langton was, I believe, a quarter of an hour in the room before I
      suspected he meant to speak to me, never looking near me. At last he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This poor man, I understand, ma'am, desired yesterday to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My understanding that, sir, brought me here to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man! it is a pity he did not know himself better, and that you
      should have had this trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;I would have come a hundred times to see him the
      hundredth and first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hopes, now, you will excuse him; he is very sorry not to see you; but
      he desired me to come and speak to you myself, and tell you he hopes you
      will excuse him, for he feels himself too weak for such an interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastily got up, left him my most affectionate respects, and every good
      wish I could half utter, and ran back to the coach. Ah, my Susy! I have
      never been to Bolt-court since! I then drove to poor Miss Strange,<a
      href="#linknote-187" name="linknoteref-187" id="linknoteref-187">[187]</a>
      to make inquiries of the maid but Andrew ran out to the coach door, and
      told me all hope was at an end. In short, the next day was fatal to both!&mdash;the
      same day!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>December 20.</i>&mdash;This day was the ever-honoured, ever-lamented
      Dr. Johnson committed to the earth. Oh, how sad a day to me! My father
      attended, and so did Charles.<a href="#linknote-188" name="linknoteref-188"
       id="linknoteref-188">[188]</a> I could not keep my eyes dry all day; nor
      can I now, in the recollecting it; but let me pass over what to mourn is
      now so vain!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>December 30.</i>&mdash;In the evening I went to Mrs. Chapone. I was
      late, on account of the coach, and all her party was assembled. This was
      the first time I had seen any of them, except Mrs. Ord, since last spring.
      I was received with the utmost kindness by them all, but chiefly by Mrs.
      Chapone herself, who has really, I believe, a sincere regard for me. I had
      talk with all of them, except Mrs. Levison, with whom I have merely a
      courtesying acquaintance. But I was very sad within; the loss of dear Dr.
      Johnson&mdash;the flight of Mrs. Thrale, the death of poor Miss Kitty
      Cambridge, and of poor, good Miss Strange,&mdash;all these home and bosom
      strokes, which had all struck me since my last meeting this society, were
      revolving in my mind the whole time I stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas Pepys talked to me a great deal of Mrs. Thrale, and read me a
      letter from her, which seems to shew her gay and happy. I hope it shews
      not false colours. No one else named her&mdash;-but poor Dr. Johnson was
      discussed repeatedly. How melancholy will all these circumstances render
      these once so pleasant meetings.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY IS FAVOURABLY NOTICED BY THE KING AND QUEEN.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [The pleasantest portion of the following section of the
     Diary is that which relates to the growing intimacy between
     Fanny and Mrs. Delany.  It was a friendship, however, which
     proved dear to Fanny in every sense of the word.  On the one
     hand the mutual affection which subsisted between her and a
     lady in every way so worthy of her regard, was a source of
     continual gratification to both; on the other hand it was
     the immediate cause of an event which may be, without
     exaggeration, described as the greatest misfortune of
     Fanny's life&mdash;her ill-starred appointment at Court.  We
     fully share Macaulay's indignation at this absurd and
     singularly unsuitable appointment.  Its consequences to
     Fanny were almost disastrous; yet the reader will reap the
     reward of her suffering in perusing the brilliant pages in
     which her humour and penetration have invested with an
     interest not its own the frivolous tattle of her commonplace
     companions.  Her account of the royal family is on the whole
     favourable.  The princesses appear to have been really
     amiable and, so far as etiquette would permit, sensible
     young women.  Of the king and queen we know few things which
     are more to their credit than that they should have been
     able to inspire Fanny with a regard so obviously sincere.
     But even Fanny, with all her loyal partiality, could make no
     more of them than a well-meaning couple, whose conversation
     never rose above the commonplace.  After all, we can hardly
     help feeling that the whole of this Court Diary,
     entertaining as it is, would be well exchanged for the
     description, in Fanny's animated style, of a few more
     dinner-parties at Sir Joshua's, a few more conversations
     with Edmund Burke.

     The burst of exultation with which Fanny's friends greeted
     the unhappy appointment says little for their common sense.
     Even Burke, who at least ought to have known better, fell in
     with the general infatuation, although he, if no one else
     felt that the honour was not all on Fanny's side.  He called
     in St. Martin's Street, and finding Dr. Burney and his
     daughter from home, left a card on which he had written
     these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Burke, to congratulate upon the honour
     done by the Queen to Miss Burney,&mdash;and to herself.&rdquo;

     The office which Fanny shared with that &ldquo;old hag,&rdquo; Mrs.
     Schwellenberg, was that of keeper of the robes, and she
     entered upon her new duties in the month Of July, 1786.
     Dress had always been one of the last subjects about which
     she troubled herself, and her want of experience in this
     all-important matter was graciously taken into consideration
     by the queen.  The duties of the place were lightened, or,
     at least, altered in her favour. The difficulties with
     respect to jewellery, laces, and Court habiliments, and the
     other routine business belonging to the dress manufactory
     appertained to her colleague, Mrs. Schwellenberg; the manual
     labours and cares devolved upon the wardrobewomen; while
     from herself all that officially was required was assiduous
     attention, unremitting readiness for every summons to the
     dressing&mdash;room, not unfrequent long readings, and perpetual
     sojourn at the palace.<a href="#linknote-189" name="linknoteref-189"

      FANNY BURNEY TO DR. BURNEY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      St. James's-place,
    </h3>
    <p>
      Aug. 24.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must tell you, dearest sir, a tale concerning Mrs. Delany, which I am
      sure you will hear with true pleasure. Among the many inferior losses
      which have been included in her great and irreparable calamity,<a
      href="#linknote-190" name="linknoteref-190" id="linknoteref-190">[190]</a>
      has been that of a country house for the summer, which she had in
      Bulstrode, and which for the half of every year was her constant home. The
      Duke of Portland behaved with the utmost propriety and feeling upon this
      occasion, and was most earnest to accommodate her to the best of his
      power, with every comfort to which she had been accustomed; but this
      noblest of women declared she loved the memory of her friend beyond all
      other things, and would not suffer it to be tainted in the misjudging
      world by an action that would be construed into a reflection upon her
      will, as if deficient in consideration to her. She steadily, therefore,
      refused all offers, though made to her with even painful earnestness, and
      though solicited till her refusal became a distress to herself
    </p>
    <p>
      This transaction was related, I believe, to their majesties and Lady
      Weymouth, the duchess's eldest daughter, was commissioned to wait upon
      Mrs. Delany with this message, That the queen was extremely anxious about
      her health, and very apprehensive lest continuing in London during the
      summer should be prejudicial to it: she entreated her, therefore, to
      accept a house belonging to the king at Windsor, which she should order to
      be fitted up for her immediately; and she desired Lady Weymouth to give
      her time to consider this proposal, and by no means to hurry her; as well
      as to assure her, that happy as it would make her to have one she so
      sincerely esteemed as a neighbour, she should remember her situation, and
      promise not to be troublesome to her. The king, at the same time, desired
      to be allowed to stand to the additional expenses incurred by the
      maintenance of two houses, and that Mrs. Delany would accept from him 300
      pounds a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be needless to tell you how Mrs. Delany was touched by this
      benevolence. Yet she dreaded accepting what she feared would involve her
      in a new course of life, and force her into notice and connexions she
      wished to drop or avoid. She took the time the queen so considerately gave
      her for deliberation, and she consulted with some of her old friends. They
      all agreed there must be no refusal, and Lady Weymouth was made the
      messenger of her majesty's offer being accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house, therefore, is now fitting up, and the king sees after the
      workmen himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days ago, Miss Planta<a href="#linknote-191" name="linknoteref-191"
       id="linknoteref-191">[191]</a> was sent from the queen, with very kind
      inquiries after Mrs. Delany's health, and information that she would
      receive a summons very soon. She told her, also, that as the house might
      still require a longer time in preparation than would suit Mrs. Delany to
      wait in London, the queen had ordered some apartments in the Castle, which
      lately belonged to Prince Edward, to be got ready with all speed, that she
      might reside in them till her own house was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the state of her affairs. I am now with her entirely. At first I
      slept at home; but going after supper, and coming before breakfast, was
      inconvenient, and she has therefore contrived me a bed-room....

    <p>
      All our movements are at present uncertain; Mrs. Delany's Windsor house is
      still unfinished, but I suppose it will be fit for her reception by the
      beginning of next week, and I have the happiest reasons for hoping she
      will then be fit for it herself. Her maid has been to see what forwardness
      it is in, and this was her report:&mdash;She was ordered to wait upon Miss
      Goldsworthy,<a href="#linknote-192" name="linknoteref-192"
       id="linknoteref-192">[192]</a> by the king's direction, who heard of her
      being sent to inspect the house; and there she received commands, in the
      name of both king and queen, to see that Mrs. Delany brought with her
      nothing but herself and clothes, as they insisted upon fitting up her
      habitation with everything themselves, including not only plate, china,
      glass, and linen, but even all sort of stores&mdash;wine, sweetmeats,
      pickles, etc. Their earnestness to save her every care, and give her every
      gratification in their power, is truly benevolent and amiable. They seem
      to know and feel her worth as if they had never worn crowns, or, wearing,
      annexed no value to them.

    <h2>
      A VISIT TO MRS. DELANY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Windsor, Saturday, Nov. 25&mdash;I got to Hounslow almost at the same
      moment with Mrs. Astley, my dear Mrs. Delany's maid, who was sent to meet
      me. As soon as she had satisfied my inquiries concerning her lady, she was
      eager to inform me that the queen had drunk tea with Mrs. Delany the day
      before, and had asked when I should come, and heard the time; and that
      Mrs. Delany believed she would be with her again that evening, and desire
      to see me. This was rather fidgetting intelligence. I rather, in my own
      mind, thought the queen would prefer giving me the first evening alone
      with my dear old friend. I found that sweet lady not so well as I had
      hoped, and strongly affected by afflicting recollections at sight of me.
      With all her gentleness and resignation, bursts of sorrow break from her
      still whenever we are alone together, for the Duchess of Portland was a
      boson' friend to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Port.<a href="#linknote-193" name="linknoteref-193"
       id="linknoteref-193">[193]</a> who is a truly lovely girl, received me
      with her usual warmth of joy, and was most impatient to whisper me that
      &ldquo;all the princesses intended to come and see me.&rdquo; She is just at the age
      to doat upon an ado, and nothing so much delights her as the thought of my
      presentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany acquainted me that the queen, in their first interview, upon
      her coming to this house, said to her, &ldquo;Why did not you bring your friend
      Miss Burney with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My dear Mrs. Delany was very much gratified by such an attention to
      whatever could be thought interesting to her, but, with her usual
      propriety, answered that, in coming to a house of her majesty's, she could
      not presume to ask anybody without immediate and express permission. &ldquo;The
      king, however,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;made the very same inquiry when I saw him
      next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, Nov. 26.</i>&mdash;So now the royal encounters, for a while at
      least, are out of all question. Nobody came last night, though Mrs. Delany
      I saw, and Miss Port. I heard, in continual expectation; but this morning,
      Mr. Battiscombe, apothecary to the household, called, and said that an
      express arrived from Germany yesterday afternoon, with an account of the
      death of the queen's youngest brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen,&mdash;whose domestic virtues rise upon me every hour, is
      strongly attached to all her family, and in much affliction at this news;
      for though this brother was quite a boy when she left Germany, he has
      twice been to visit her in, England. None of the royal family will appear
      till the mourning takes place; the queen, perhaps, may shut herself up
      still longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, quite incog. quite alone, and quite privately, the king came,
      and was shut up with Mrs. Delany for an hour. It is out of rule for any of
      the family to be seen till in mourning, but he knew she was anxious for an
      account of the queen. I had a very narrow escape of being surprised by
      him, which would have vexed me, as he only meant to see Mrs. Delany by
      herself, though she says he told her he was very glad to hear I was come.

    <h2>
      ROYAL CURIOSITY ABOUT MISS BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday, Dec. 1.</i>&mdash;To-day the queen sent Miss Planta to tell
      Mrs. Delany that if she would not yet venture to the Lodge, she would come
      to her in the evening. Mrs. Delany accepted the gracious offer, and, at
      tea-time, she came, as well as the king, and spent two hours here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany told me afterwards, that the queen was very low-spirited, and
      seemed to wish for nothing but the solace of sitting perfectly quiet. She
      is a sweet woman, and has all the domestic affections warm and strong in
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless they talked of me, she says, a good deal&mdash;and the king
      asked many questions about me. There is a new play, he told Mrs. Delany,
      coming out; &ldquo;and it is said to be Miss Burney's!&rdquo; Mrs. Delany immediately
      answered that she knew the report must be untrue. &ldquo;But I hope she is not
      idle?&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;I hope she is writing something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Mrs. Delany said, I know not; but he afterwards inquired what she
      thought of my writing a play?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you wish about it, Mrs. Delany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany hesitated, and the queen then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish what I know Mrs. Delany does&mdash;that she may not; for though
      her reputation is so high, her character, by all I hear, is too delicate
      to suit with writing for the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sweet queen! I could have kissed the hem of her garment for that speech,
      and I could not resist writing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why My opinion is what I believe to be Miss Burney's own; that It is too
      public and hazardous a style of writing for her quiet and fearful turn of
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have really the grace to be a little ashamed of scribbling this, but I
      know I can scribble nothing my dear father will be more curious to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Saturday, Dec. 3</i>&mdash;This morning we had better news of the
      princess&mdash;and Mrs. Delany went again to the Lodge in the evening, to
      the queen. When Mrs. Delany returned, she confirmed the good accounts of
      the Princess Elizabeth's amendment. She had told the queen I was going
      to-morrow to Thames Ditton, for a week; and was asked many questions about
      my coming back, which the queen said she was sure I should be glad to do
      from Mrs. Walsingham to Mrs. Delany. O most penetrating queen!
    </p>
    <p>
      She gratified Mrs. Delany by many kind speeches, of being sorry I was
      going, and glad I was returning, and so forth. Mrs. Delany then told her I
      had been reading &ldquo;The Clandestine Marriage&rdquo; to her, which the queen had
      recommended, and she thanked her majesty for the very great pleasure she
      had received from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O then,&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;if Miss Burney reads to you, what a pleasure
      you must have to make her read her own works!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany laughed, and exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ma'am! read her own works!&mdash;your majesty has no notion of Miss
      Burney! I believe she would as soon die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, led to a great deal of discussion, in the midst of which
      the queen said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Dr. Burney, Mrs. Delany?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, extremely well,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Delany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think him,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;a very agreeable and entertaining man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There, my dear father! said I not well just now, O most penetrating queen?
    </p>
    <p>
      So here ends my Windsor journal, part the first. Tomorrow morning I go for
      my week to Thames Ditton.

    <h2>
      AN ANTICIPATED ROYAL INTERVIEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Windsor, Wednesday, Dec. 14</i>&mdash;Yesterday I returned to my dear
      Mrs. Delany, from Thames Ditton, and had the great concern of finding her
      very unwell. Mr. Bernard Dewes, one of her nephews, and his little girl, a
      sweet child of seven years old, were with her, and, of course, Miss Port.
      She had been hurried, though only with pleasure, and her emotion, first in
      receiving, and next in entertaining them, had brought on a little fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She revived in the afternoon, and I had the pleasure of reading to her a
      play of Shakspeare's, that she had not heard for forty years, and which I
      had never read since I was a child,&mdash;&ldquo;The Comedy of Errors;&rdquo;&mdash;and
      we found in it all the entertainment belonging to an excellent farce, and
      all the objections belonging to an indifferent play, but the spirit with
      which she enters into every part of everything she hears, gives a sort of
      theatric effect to whatever is read to her; and my spirits rise in her
      presence, with the joy of exciting hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am now obliged, by what follows, to confess a little discussion I
      have had with my dear Mrs. Delany, almost all the time I spent with her at
      first, and now again upon my return, relative to the royal interview, so
      long in expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately upon my arrival, she had imagined, by what had preceded it,
      that a visit would instantly ensue here, and I should have a summons to
      appear; but the death of the queen's brother, which was known the very
      night I came, confined her majesty and all the family for some days to the
      Lodge; and the dangerous illness of the Princess Elizabeth next took
      place, in occupying all their thoughts, greatly to their credit. My dear
      old friend, however, earnest I should have an honour which her grateful
      reverence for their majesties makes her regard very highly, had often
      wished me to stay in the room when they came to see her, assuring me that
      though they were so circumstanced as not to send for a stranger, she knew
      they would be much pleased to meet with me. This, however, was more than I
      could assent to, without infinite pain, and that she was too kind to make
      a point of my enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, upon my return, she began again the same reasoning; the
      Princess Elizabeth had relapsed, and she knew, during her being worse,
      there was no chance the queen would take any active step towards a
      meeting. &ldquo;But she inquires,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;so much about you,
      and is so earnest that you should be with me, that I am sure she wants to
      see and converse with you. You will see her, too, with more ease to
      yourself by being already in the room, than from being summoned. I would
      not for the world put this request to you, if I were not sure she wishes
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no withstanding the word &ldquo;request&rdquo; from Mrs. Delany, and little
      as I liked the business, I could not but comply. What next was to be done,
      was to beg directions for the rencounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now though you, my dear father, have had an audience, and you, my dear
      Susan, are likely enough to avoid one, yet I think the etiquettes on these
      occasions will be equally new to you both; for one never inquired into
      them, and the other has never thought of them. Here, at Windsor, where
      more than half the people we see are belonging to the Court, and where all
      the rest are trying to be in the same predicament, the intelligence I have
      obtained must be looked upon as accurate, and I shall, therefore give it.
      In full confidence you will both regard it as a valuable addition to your
      present stock of Court knowledge, and read it with that decent awe the
      dignity of the topic requires!

    <h2>
      DIRECTIONS FOR A PRIVATE ENCOUNTER WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ... To come, then, to those particular instructions I received myself, and
      which must not be regarded as having anything to do with general rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do beg of you,&rdquo; said dear Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;When the queen or the king
      speak to you, not to answer with mere monosyllables. The queen often
      complains to me of the difficulty with which she can get any conversation,
      as she not only always has to start the subjects, but, commonly, entirely
      to support them: and she says there is nothing she so much loves as
      conversation, and nothing she finds so hard to get. She is always best
      pleased to have the answers that are made her lead on to further
      discourse. Now, as I know she wishes to be acquainted with you, and
      converse with you, I do really entreat you not to draw back from her, nor
      to stop conversation with only answering 'Yes,' or 'No.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a most tremendous injunction; however, I could not but promise
      her I would do the best I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this, nevertheless, she readily agreed, that if upon entering the room,
      they should take no notice of me, I might quietly retire. And that,
      believe me, will not be very slowly! They cannot find me in this house
      without knowing who I am, and therefore they can be at no loss whether to
      speak to me or not, from incertitude.

    <h2>
      A PANIC.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      In the midst of all this, the queen came!
    </h3>
    <p>
      I heard the thunder at the door, and, panic struck, away flew all my
      resolutions and agreements, and away after them flew I!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't be angry, my dear father&mdash;I would have stayed if I could, and I
      meant to stay&mdash;-but, when the moment came, neither my preparations
      nor intentions availed, and I arrived at my own room, ere I well knew I
      had left the drawing-room, and quite breathless between the race I ran
      with Miss Port and the joy of escaping, Mrs. Delany, though a little vexed
      at the time, was not afterwards, when she found the queen very much
      dispirited by a relapse of the poor Princess Elizabeth. She inquired if I
      was returned, and hoped I now came to make a longer stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, Dec. 16.</i>&mdash;Yesterday morning we had a much better
      account of the Princess Elizabeth; and Mrs. Delany said to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you will escape no longer, for if their uneasiness ceases, I am sure
      they will send for you, when they come next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be sent for, I confessed to her, would really be more formidable than
      to be surprised; but to pretend to be surprised would answer no purpose in
      making the meeting easy to me, and therefore I preferred letting the
      matter take its chance.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;THE KING! AUNT, THE KING!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      After dinner, while Mrs. Delany was left alone, as usual, to take a little
      rest,&mdash;for sleep it but seldom proves,&mdash;Mr. B. Dewes, his little
      daughter, Miss Port, and myself, went into the drawing-room. And here,
      while, to pass the time, I was amusing the little girl with teaching her
      some Christmas games, in which her father and cousin joined, Mrs. Delany
      came in. We were all in the middle of the room, and in some confusion;&mdash;but
      she had but just come up to us to inquire what was going forwards, and I
      was disentangling myself from Miss Dewes, to be ready to fly off if any
      one knocked at the street-door, when the door of the drawing-room was
      again opened, and a large man, in deep mourning, appeared at it, entering,
      and shutting it himself without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ghost could not more have scared me, when I discovered, by its glitter
      on the black, a star! The general disorder had prevented his being seen,
      except by myself, who was always on the watch, till Miss Port, turning
      round, exclaimed, &ldquo;The king!&mdash;aunt, the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O mercy! thought I, that I were but out of the room! which way shall I
      escape? and how pass him unnoticed? There is but the single door at which
      he entered, in the room! Every one scampered out of the way: Miss Port, to
      stand next the door; Mr. Bernard Dewes to a corner opposite it; his little
      girl clung to me; and Mrs. Delany advanced to meet his majesty, who, after
      quietly looking on till she saw him, approached, and inquired how she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then spoke to Mr. Bernard, whom he had already met two or three times
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now retreated to the wall, and purposed gliding softly, though
      speedily, out of the room; but before I had taken a single step, the king,
      in a loud whisper to Mrs. Delany, said, &ldquo;Is that Miss Burney?&rdquo;&mdash;and on her
      answering, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he bowed, and with a countenance of the most
      perfect good humour, came close up to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A most profound reverence on my part arrested the progress of my intended
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been come back, Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily he did not hear me, and repeated his question and whether the
      second time he heard me or not, I don't know, but he made a little civil
      inclination of his head, and went back to Mrs. Delany.
    </p>
    <p>
      He insisted she should sit down, though he stood himself, and began to
      give her an account of the Princess Elizabeth, who once again was
      recovering, and trying, at present, James's powders. She had been blooded,
      he said, twelve times in this last fortnight, and had lost seventy-five
      ounces of blood, besides undergoing blistering and other discipline. He
      spoke of her illness with the strongest emotion, and seemed quite filled
      with concern for her danger and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany next inquired for the younger children. They had all, he said,
      the whooping-cough, and were soon to be removed to Kew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;for any other reason than change of air for themselves;
      though I am pretty certain I have never had the distemper myself, and the
      queen thinks she has not had it either:&mdash;we shall take our chance.
      When the two eldest had it, I sent them away, and would not see them till
      it was over; but now there are so many of them that there would be no end
      to separations, so I let it take its course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany expressed a good deal of concern at his running this risk, but
      he laughed at it, and said, he was much more afraid of catching the
      rheumatism, which has been threatening one of his shoulders lately,
      However, he added, he should hunt, the next morning, in defiance of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good deal of talk then followed about his own health, and the extreme
      temperance by which he preserved it. The fault of his constitution, he
      said, was a tendency to excessive fat, which he kept, however, in order,
      by the most vigorous exercise and the strictest attention to a simple
      diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany was beginning to praise his forbearance, but he stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;'tis no virtue; I only prefer eating plain and little
      to growing diseased and infirm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this discourse, I stood quietly in the place where he had first
      spoken to me. His quitting me so soon, and conversing freely and easily
      with Mrs. Delany, proved so delightful a relief to me, that I no longer
      wished myself away; and the moment my first panic from the surprise was
      over, I diverted myself with a thousand ridiculous notions, of my own
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas games we had been showing Miss Dewes, it seemed as if we
      were still performing, as none of us thought it proper to move, though our
      manner of standing reminded one of &ldquo;Puss in the corner.&rdquo; Close to the door
      was posted Miss Port; opposite her, close to the wainscot, stood Mr.
      Dewes; at just an equal distance from him, close to a window, stood
      myself. Mrs. Delany, though seated, was at the opposite side to Miss Port;
      and his majesty kept pretty much in the middle of the room. The little
      girl, who kept close to me, did not break the order, and I could hardly
      help expecting to be beckoned, with a PUSS! PUSS! PUSS! to change places
      with one of my neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea, afterwards, gave way to another more pompous. It seemed to me
      we were acting a play. There is something so little like common and real
      life, in everybody's standing, while talking, in a room full of chairs,
      and standing, too, so aloof from each other, that I almost thought myself
      upon a stage, assisting in the representation of a tragedy,&mdash;in which
      the king played his own part, of the king; Mrs. Delany that of a venerable
      confidante; Mr. Dewes, his respectful attendant; Miss Port, a suppliant
      Virgin, waiting encouragement to bring forward some petition; Miss Dewes,
      a young orphan, intended to move the royal compassion; and myself,&mdash;a
      very solemn, sober, and decent mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fancies, however, only regaled me while I continued a quiet
      spectator, and without expectation of being called into play. But the
      king, I have reason to think, meant only to give me time to recover from
      my first embarrassment; and I feel infinitely obliged to his good breeding
      and consideration, which perfectly answered, for before he returned to me,
      I was entirely recruited.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go back to my narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the discourse upon health and strength was over, the king went up to
      the table, and looked at a book of prints, from Claude Lorraine, which had
      been brought down for Miss Dewes; but Mrs. Delany, by mistake, told him
      they were for me. He turned over a leaf or two, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, does Miss Burney draw, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The too was pronounced very civilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not, Sir,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Delany &ldquo;at least, she does not tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;that's nothing; she is not apt to tell! she
      never does tell, you know!&mdash;Her father told me that himself. He told
      me the whole history of her 'Evelina.' And I shall never forget his face
      when he spoke of his feelings at first taking up the book!&mdash;he looked
      quite frightened, just as if he was doing it that moment! I never can
      forget his face while I live!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE KING CATEGORICALLY QUESTIONS Miss BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then coming up close to me, the king said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&mdash;what?&mdash;how was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;&mdash;cried I, not well understanding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you&mdash;how happened it&mdash;what?&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I only wrote, Sir, for my own amusement,&mdash;only in some odd,
      idle hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your publishing&mdash;your printing,&mdash;how was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was only, sir,&mdash;only because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated most abominably, not knowing how to tell him a long story, and
      growing terribly confused at these questions;&mdash;besides,&mdash;to say
      the truth, his own &ldquo;what? what?&rdquo; so reminded me of those vile
      &ldquo;Probationary Odes,&rdquo; that, in the midst of all my flutter, I was really
      hardly able to keep my countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The What! was then repeated, with so earnest a look, that, forced to say
      something, I stammeringly answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought-sir-it would look very well in print!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do really flatter myself this is the silliest speech I ever made! I am
      quite provoked with myself for it; but a fear of laughing made me eager to
      utter anything, and by no means conscious, till I had spoken, of what I
      was saying. He laughed very heartily himself,&mdash;well he might&mdash;and
      walked away to enjoy it, crying out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fair indeed! that's being very fair and honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, returning to me again, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father&mdash;how came you not to show him what you wrote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was too much ashamed of it, sir, seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Literal truth that, I am sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did he find it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know myself, sir. He never would tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Literal truth again, my dear father, as you can testify.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you get it printed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent it, sir, to a bookseller my father never employed, and that I
      never had seen myself, Mr. Lowndes, in full hope by that means he never
      would hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could you manage that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By means of a brother, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O!&mdash;you confided in a brother, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&mdash;that is, for the publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What entertainment you must have had from hearing people's conjectures,
      before you were known! Do you remember any of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that Mr. Baretti<a href="#linknote-194" name="linknoteref-194"
       id="linknoteref-194">[194]</a> laid a wager it was written by a man for no
      woman, he said, could have kept her own counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This diverted him extremely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how was it,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you thought most likely for your father
      to discover you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, sir, I have supposed I must have dropt some of the manuscript;
      sometimes, that one of my sisters betrayed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! your sister?&mdash;what, not your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he could not, for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was going on, but he laughed so much I could not be heard, exclaiming,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vastly well! I see you are of Mr. Baretti's'mind, and think your brother
      could keep your secret, and not your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; cried he presently, &ldquo;how was it first known to you, you were
      betrayed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a letter, sir, from another sister. I was very ill, and in the
      country; and she wrote me word that my father had taken up a review, in
      which the book was mentioned, and had put his finger upon its name, and
      said&mdash;'Contrive to get that book for me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when he got it,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;he told me he was afraid of looking
      at it! and never can I forget his face when he mentioned his first opening
      it. But you have not kept your pen unemployed all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I have, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I believe I have exhausted myself, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed aloud at this, and went and told it to Mrs. Delany, civilly
      treating a plain fact as a mere bon mot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to me again, he said, more seriously, &ldquo;But you have not
      determined against writing, any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-o, sir&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made no vow&mdash;no real resolution of that sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You only wait for inclination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very civil little bow spoke him pleased with this answer, and he went
      again to the middle of the room, where he chiefly stood, and, addressing
      us in general, talked upon the different motives of writing, concluding
      with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there is no constraint to be put upon real genius; nothing but
      inclination can set it to work. Miss Burney, however, knows best.&rdquo; And
      then, hastily returning to me, he cried, &ldquo;What? what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I&mdash;I-believe not, certainly,&rdquo; quoth I, very awkwardly, for
      I seemed taking a violent compliment only as my due; but I knew not how to
      put him off as I would another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then made some inquiries concerning the pictures with which the room is
      hung, and which are all Mrs. Delany's own painting and a little discourse
      followed, upon some of the masters whose pictures she has copied. This was
      all with her; for nobody ever answers him without being immediately
      addressed by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then came to me again, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your father about anything at present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, he goes on, when he has time, with his history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he write quick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, when he writes from himself; but in his history he has so many
      books to consult, that sometimes he spends three days in finding
      authorities for a single passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; that must be unavoidable.&rdquo; He pursued these inquiries some
      time, and then went again to his general station before the fire, and Mrs.
      Delany inquired if he meant to hunt the next day. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; and,
      a little pointedly, Mrs. Delany said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would the hunted could but feel as much pleasure as the hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king understood her, and with some quickness, called out, &ldquo;Pray what
      did you hunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, looking round at us all,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Mrs. Delany once hunted herself?&mdash;and
      in a long gown, and a great hoop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems she had told his majesty an adventure of that sort which had
      befallen her in her youth, from some accident in which her will had no
      share.

      While this was talking over, a violent thunder was made at the door. I was
      almost certain it was the queen. Once more I would have given anything to
      escape; but in vain. I had been informed that nobody ever quitted the
      royal presence, after having been conversed with, till motioned to
      withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Port, according to established etiquette on these occasions, opened
      the door which she stood next, by putting her hand behind her, and slid
      out, backwards, into the hall, to light the queen in. The door soon opened
      again, and her majesty entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately seeing the king, she made him a low curtsey, and cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your majesty is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I ran here, without speaking to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen had been at the lower Lodge, to see the Princess Elizabeth, as
      the king had before told us.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then, hastened up to Mrs. Delany, with both her hands held out,
      saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Delany, how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly after, I felt her eye on my face. I believe, too, she curtsied
      to me; but though I saw the bend, I was too near-sighted to be sure it was
      intended for me. I was hardly ever in a situation more embarrassing&mdash;-I
      dared not return what I was not certain I had received, yet considered
      myself as appearing quite a monster, to stand stiff-necked, if really
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the same moment, she spoke to Mr. Bernard Dewes, and then nodded
      to my little clinging girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now really ready to sink, with horrid uncertainty of what I was
      doing, or what I should do,&mdash;when his majesty, who I fancy saw my
      distress, most good-humouredly said to the queen something, but I was too
      much flurried to remember what, except these words,&mdash;&ldquo;I have been
      telling Miss Burney&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Relieved from so painful a dilemma, I immediately dropped a curtsey. She
      made one to me in the same moment, and, with a very smiling countenance,
      came up to me; but she could not speak, for the king went on talking,
      eagerly, and very gaily, repeating to her every word I had said during our
      conversation upon &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; its publication, etc. etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told her of Baretti's wager, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;But she heard of a
      great many conjectures about the author, before it was known, and of
      Baretti, an admirable thing!&mdash;he laid a bet it must be a man, as no
      woman, he said, could have kept her own counsel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen, laughing a little, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is quite too bad an affront to us!&mdash;Don't you think so?&rdquo;
       addressing herself to me, with great gentleness of voice and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assented; and the king continued his relation, which she listened to
      with a look of some interest; but when he told her some particulars of my
      secrecy, she again spoke to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But! your sister was your confidant, was she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My sisters, I might have said, but I was always glad to have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried the king, laughing, &ldquo;but I assure you she is of Baretti's
      opinion herself; for I asked her if she thought it was her sister or her
      brother that betrayed her to her father?&mdash;and she says her sister,
      she thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Esther!&mdash;but I shall make her amends by what follows; for the
      queen, again addressing me, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to betray to a father is no crime-don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed; and plainly saw she thought Esther, if Esther it was, had only
      done right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king then went on, and when he had finished his narration the queen
      took her seat. She made Mrs. Delany sit next her, and Miss Port brought
      her some tea.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;MISS BURNEY PLAYS&mdash;BUT NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The king, meanwhile, came to me again, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Are you musical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a performer, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, going from me to the queen, he cried,&mdash;&ldquo;She does not play.&rdquo; I
      did not hear what the queen answered&mdash;-she spoke in a low voice, and
      seemed much out of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now talked together a little while, about the Princess Elizabeth, and
      the king mentioned having had a very promising account from her physician,
      Sir George Baker and the queen soon brightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king then returned to me and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you never play?&mdash;never touch the keys at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never to acknowledge it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that's it!&rdquo; cried he; and flying to the queen, cried, &ldquo;She does play&mdash;but
      not to acknowledge it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was now in a most horrible panic once more; pushed so very home, I could
      answer no other than I did, for these categorical questions almost
      constrain categorical answers; and here, at Windsor, it seems an absolute
      point that whatever they ask must be told, and whatever they desire must
      be done. Think but, then, of my consternation, in expecting their commands
      to perform! My dear father, pity me!
    </p>
    <p>
      The eager air with which he returned to me fully explained what was to
      follow. I hastily, therefore, spoke first, in order to stop him, crying&mdash;&ldquo;I
      never, sir, played to anybody but myself!&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; cried he, looking incredulous; &ldquo;what, not to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even to me, sir!&rdquo; cried my kind Mrs. Delany, who saw what was
      threatening me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&mdash;are you sure?&rdquo; cried he, disappointed; &ldquo;but&mdash;but you'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never, sir,&rdquo; cried I, very earnestly, &ldquo;played in my life, but when
      I could hear nobody else&mdash;quite alone, and from a mere love of any
      musical sounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repeated all this to the queen, whose answers I never heard; but when
      he once more came back, with a face that looked unwilling to give it up,
      in my fright I had recourse to dumb show, and raised my hands in a
      supplicating fold, with a most begging countenance to be excused. This,
      luckily, succeeded; he understood me very readily, and laughed a little,
      but made a sort of desisting, or rather complying, little bow, and said no
      more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt very much obliged to him, for I saw his curiosity was all alive, I
      wished I could have kissed his hand. He still, however, kept me in talk,
      and still upon music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it appears quite as strange to meet with people who
      have no ear for music, and cannot distinguish one air from another, as to
      meet with people who are dumb. Lady Bell Finch once told me that she had
      heard there was some difference between a psalm, a minuet, and a country
      dance, but she declared they all sounded alike to her! There are people
      who have no eye for difference of colour. The Duke of Marlborough actually
      cannot tell scarlet from green!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then told me an anecdote of his mistaking one of those colours for
      another, which was very laughable, but I do not remember it clearly enough
      to write it. How unfortunate for true virtuosi that such an eye should
      possess objects worthy the most discerning&mdash;the treasures of
      Blenheim! &ldquo;I do not find, though,&rdquo; added his majesty, &ldquo;that this defect
      runs in his family, for Lady Di Beauclerk, draws very finely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then went to Mr. Bernard Dewes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly upon his leaving me, a very gentle voice called out&mdash;&ldquo;Miss
      Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the queen's. I walked a little nearer her, and a gracious
      inclination of her head made me go quite up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;at Mrs. Walsingham's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a pretty place, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever there before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, shocking! shocking! thought I; what will Mrs. Delany say to all these
      monosyllables?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has not she lately made some improvements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am; she has built a conservatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed some questions about its situation, during which the king
      came up to us; and she then, ceasing to address me in particular, began a
      general sort of conversation, with a spirit and animation that I had not
      at all expected, and which seemed the result of the great and benevolent
      pleasure she took in giving entertainment to Mrs. Delany.

    <h2>
      A DRAWING-ROOM DURING A FOG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The subject was the last Drawing-room, which she had been in town to keep
      on Thursday, during the dense fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, ma'am,&rdquo; cried she to Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;it was so dark, there
      was no seeing anything, and no knowing any body. And Lady Harcourt could
      be of no help to tell me who people were, for when it was light, she can't
      see and now it was dark, I could not see myself. So it was in vain for me
      to go on in that manner, without knowing which I had spoken to, and which
      was waiting for me; so I said to Lady Harcourt, 'We had better stop, and
      stand quite still, for I don't know anybody, no more than you do. But if
      we stand still, they will all come up in the end, and we must ask them who
      they are, and if I have spoken to them yet, or not: for it is very odd to
      do it, but what else can we manage?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her accent is a little foreign, and very prettily so; and her emphasis has
      that sort of changeability, which gives an interest to everything she
      utters. But her language is rather peculiar than foreign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Besides,&rdquo;' added she, with a very significant look, &ldquo;'if we go on here
      in the dark, maybe I shall push against somebody, or somebody will push
      against me&mdash;which is the more likely to happen.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then gave an account of some circumstances which attended the
      darkness, in a manner not only extremely lively, but mixed, at times, with
      an archness and humour that made it very entertaining. She chiefly
      addressed herself to Mrs. Delany; and to me, certainly, she would not,
      separately, have been so communicative; but she contrived, with great
      delicacy, to include me in the little party, by frequently looking at me,
      and always with an expression that invited my participation in the
      conversation. And, indeed, though I did not join in words, I shared very
      openly in the pleasure of her recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;so there was standing by me a man that I could not
      see in the face; but I saw the twisting of his bow; and I said to Lady
      Harcourt, 'I am sure that must be nobody but the Duke of Dorset.'&mdash;'Dear,'
      she says, 'how can you tell that?'&mdash;'Only ask,' said I; and so it
      proved he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;he is pretty well again; he can smile again, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems his features had appeared to be fixed, or stiffened. It is said,
      he has been obliged to hold his hand to his mouth, to hide it, ever since
      his stroke,&mdash;which he refuses to acknowledge was paralytic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen looked as if some comic notion had struck her, and, after
      smiling a little while to herself, said, with a sort of innocent archness,
      very pleasing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, it is very wrong to laugh at such things,&mdash;I know that;
      but yet, I could not help thinking, when his mouth was in that way, that
      it was very lucky people's happiness did not depend upon his smiles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, she named other persons, whose behaviour and manners pointed
      them out to her, in defiance of obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;came up to me, that I could not see, so I was forced
      to ask who she was; and immediately she burst into a laugh. 'O,' says I,
      'that can be only Mrs. De Rolles!'&mdash;and so it proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Methinks, by this trait, she should be a near relation to my Miss
      Larolles!<a href="#linknote-195" name="linknoteref-195"

    <h2>
      WILL MISS BURNEY WRITE ANY MORE?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When these, and some more anecdotes which I do not so clearly remember,
      were told, the king left us, and went to Mr. Bernard Dewes. A pause
      ensuing, I, too, drew back, meaning to return to my original station,
      which, being opposite the fire, was never a bad one. But the moment I
      began retreating, the queen, bending forward, and speaking in a very low
      voice, said, &ldquo;Miss Burney!&rdquo;&mdash;and, upon my coming up to her, almost in
      a whisper, cried, &ldquo;But shall we have no more&mdash;nothing more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not but understand her, and only shook my head. The queen then, as
      if she thought she had said too much, with great sweetness and
      condescension, drew back herself, and, very delicately, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure it is, I own, a very home question, for one who has not the
      pleasure to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was quite ashamed of this apology, but did not know what to say to it.
      But how amiable a simplicity in her speaking of herself in such a style,&mdash;&ldquo;for
      one who has not the pleasure to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, indeed,&rdquo; continued she, presently, &ldquo;I would not say it, only that I
      think from what has been done, there is a power to do so much good&mdash;and
      good to young people, which is so very good a thing&mdash;that I cannot
      help wishing it could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt very grateful for this speech, and for the very soft manner in
      which she said it; and I very much wished to thank her and was trying to
      mutter something, though not very intelligibly, when the king suddenly
      coming up to us, inquired what was going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen readily repeated her kind speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king eagerly undertook to make my answer for me, crying, &ldquo;O, but she
      will write!&mdash;she only waits for inclination&mdash;she told me so.&rdquo;
       Then, speaking to me, he said, &ldquo;What&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I only laughed a little; and he again said to the queen,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will write. She told me, just now, she had made no vow against It.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;I hope not, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vow!&rdquo; cried dear Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;no, indeed, I hope she would not be so
      wicked&mdash;she who can so do what she does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she has not,&rdquo; said the king, earnestly; &ldquo;she has owned that to me
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What excessive condescension, my dear padre!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;it could be as easily done, as it is
      earnestly and universally desired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it not to be so desired,&rdquo; said the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was quite ashamed of all this, and quite sorry to make no acknowledgment
      of their great condescension in pressing such subject, and pressing it so
      much in earnest. But I really could get out nothing, so that's the truth;
      and I wish I could give a better account of my eloquence, my dear padre
      and I cannot, however, in justice any more than in inclination, go on,
      till I stop to admire the sweetness of the queen, and the consideration of
      the king, in each making me a party in their general conversation, before
      they made any particular address to me.

    <h2>
      A MUSICIAN, WITH A PROBOSCIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They afterwards spoke of Mr. Webb, a Windsor musician, who is master to
      the young princesses, and who has a nose, from some strange calamity, of
      so enormous a size that it covers all the middle of his face. I never saw
      so frightful a deformity. Mrs. Delany told the queen I had met with him,
      accidentally, when he came to give a lesson to Miss Port, and had been
      quite startled by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say so,&rdquo; said her majesty. &ldquo;I must tell Miss Burney a little trait
      of Sophia, about Mr. Webb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A small table was before the queen, who always has it brought when she is
      seated, to put her tea or work upon, or, when she has neither, to look
      comfortable, I believe; for certainly it takes off much formality in a
      standing circle. And close to this, by the gracious motion of her head,
      she kept me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When first,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;Mr. Webb was to come to Sophia, I told her
      he had had some accident to disfigure his whole face, by making him an
      enormous nose; but I desired her to remember this was a misfortune, for
      which he ought to be pitied, and that she must be sure not to laugh at it,
      nor stare at it. And she minded this very well, and behaved always very
      properly. But, while Lady Cremorne was at the Lodge, she was with Sophia
      when Mr. Webb came to give her a lesson. As soon as he was named, she
      coloured very red, and ran up to Lady Cremorne, and said to her in a
      whisper, 'Lady Cremorne, Mr. Webb has got a very great nose, but that is
      only to be pitied&mdash;so mind you don't laugh.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little princess is just nine years old!
    </p>
    <p>
      The king joined us while the queen was telling this, and added, &ldquo;Poor Mr.
      Webb was very much discountenanced when he first saw me, and tried to hide
      his nose, by a great nosegay, or I believe only a branch, which he held
      before it: but really that had so odd a look, that it was worse, and more
      ridiculous, than his nose. However, I hope he does not mind me, now, for I
      have seen him four or five times.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      GENERAL CONVERSATION: ROYALTY DEPARTS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      After this, Mrs. Delany mentioned Madame de la Fite and her son.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The queen said, &ldquo;He is a pretty little boy; and when he goes to school, it
      will do him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will she send him?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, looking at me, with a smile answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the school where Mr. Locke puts his sons. I know that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I don't know; where is it, Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Cheam, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, at young Gilpin's?&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;Is it near Mr. Locke's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; within about six miles, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen, then, with a little arch smile, that seemed to premise she
      should make me stare, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was there, at Mr. Locke's, your sister<a href="#linknote-196"
       name="linknoteref-196" id="linknoteref-196">[196]</a> laid in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, ma'am!&rdquo; cried I, out of breath with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king repeated my &ldquo;O yes!&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;I fancy&mdash;by that O&mdash;you
      were frightened a little for her? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not but assent to that; and the king, who seemed a good deal
      diverted at the accident&mdash;for he loves little babies too well to look
      upon it, as most people would, to be a shocking business&mdash;questioned
      me about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; said he,&mdash;&ldquo;how happened it? Could not she get home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so sudden, sir, and so unexpected, there was no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said the sweet queen, &ldquo;Mrs. Locke was only very happy to
      have it at her house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, ma'am,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;her kindness, and Mr. Locke's would make
      anybody think so but they are all kindness and goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard indeed,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;that they are all sensible, and
      amiable, and ingenuous, in that family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are indeed,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;and as exemplary as they are accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen Mrs. Locke,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;since she was that high;&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
      to little Miss Dewes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the queen &ldquo;I have never seen her in my life; but for all
      that, from what I hear of her, I cannot help feeling interested whenever I
      only hear her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, with a good deal of animation, she said directly to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. William Locke, ma'am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;I understand from Miss
      Burney, is now making the same wonderful progress in painting that he had
      done before in drawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen some of his drawings,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;which were charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen!&rdquo; repeated the king&mdash;&ldquo;how time flies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! for me,&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;I am always quarrelling with time! It is
      so short to do something, and so long to do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She has now and then something foreign to our idiom, that has a very
      pretty effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;always seems long when we are young, and short
      when we begin to grow old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nothing makes me so angry,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;as to hear people not
      know what to do! For me, I never have half time enough to do things. But
      what makes me most angry still, is to see people go up to a window and
      say, 'what a bad day!&mdash;dear, what shall we do such a day as this?'
      'What?' I say; 'why, employ yourselves; and then what signifies the bad
      day?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, there was some talk upon sermons, and the queen wished the
      Bishop of Chester would publish another volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you must not expect a man, while he continues
      preaching, to go on publishing. Every sermon printed, diminishes his stock
      for the pulpit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;but I believe the Bishop of Chester has
      enough to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king then praised Carr's sermons, and said he liked none but what were
      plain and unadorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I neither,&rdquo; said the queen; &ldquo;but for me, it is, I suppose, because
      the others I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king then, looking at his watch, said, &ldquo;It is eight o'clock, and if we
      don't go now, the children will be sent to the other house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your majesty,&rdquo; cried the queen, instantly rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany put on her majesty's cloak, and she took a very kind leave of
      her. She then curtsied separately to us all, and the king handed her to
      the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the custom for everybody they speak to to attend them out, but they
      would not suffer Mrs. Delany to move. Miss Port, Mr. Dewes, and his little
      daughter, and myself, all accompanied them, and saw them in their coach,
      and received their last gracious nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, Mrs. Delany confessed she had heard the king's knock
      at the door before she came into the drawing-room, but would not avow it,
      that I might not run away. Well! being over was so good a thing, that I
      could not but be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, indeed, is a most charming woman. She appears to me full of
      sense and graciousness, mingled with delicacy of mind and liveliness of
      temper. She speaks English almost perfectly well, with great choice and
      copiousness of language, though now and then with foreign idiom, and
      frequently with a foreign accent. Her manners have an easy dignity, with a
      most engaging simplicity, and she has all that fine high breeding which
      the mind, not the station, gives, of carefully avoiding to distress those
      who converse with her, or studiously removing the embarrassment she cannot
      prevent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, however he may have power, in the cabinet, to command himself,
      has, in private, the appearance of a character the most open and sincere.
      He speaks his opinions without reserve, and seems to trust them
      intuitively to his hearers, from a belief they will make no ill use of
      them. His countenance is full of inquiry, to gain information without
      asking it, probably from believing that to be the nearest road to truth.
      All I saw of both was the most perfect good humour, good spirits, ease,
      and pleasantness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their behaviour to each other speaks the most cordial confidence and
      happiness. The king seems to admire as much as he enjoys her conversation,
      and to covet her participation in everything he either sees or hears. The
      queen appears to feel the most grateful regard for him, and to make it her
      chief study to raise his consequence with others, by always marking that
      she considers herself, though queen to the nation, only to him, the first
      and most obedient of subjects. Indeed, in their different ways, and
      allowing for the difference of their characters, they left me equally
      charmed both with their behaviour to each other and to myself.

    <h2>
      THE KING AGAIN: TEA TABLE ETIQUETTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, Dec. 19</i>&mdash;In the evening, while Mrs. Delany, Miss Port,
      and I were sitting and working together in the drawing-room, the door was
      opened, and the king entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all started up; Miss Port flew to her modest post by the door, and I to
      my more comfortable one opposite the fire, which caused me but a slight
      and gentle retreat, and Mrs. Delany he immediately commanded to take her
      own place again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was full of joy for the Princess Elizabeth. He had been to the lower
      Lodge, and found her in a sweet sleep, and she was now, he said, in a
      course of James's powders, from which he hoped her perfect restoration. I
      fear, however, it is still but precarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany congratulated him, and then inquired after the whooping-cough.
      The children, he said, were better, and were going to Kew for some days,
      to change the air. He and the queen had been themselves, in the morning,
      to Kew, to see that their rooms were fit for their reception. He could
      not, he said, be easy to take any account but from his own eyes, when they
      were sick. He seems, indeed, one of the most tender fathers in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot pretend to write this meeting with the method and minuteness of
      the first; for that took me so long, that I have not time to spare for
      such another detail. Besides the novelty is now over, and I have not the
      same inducement to be so very circumstantial. But the principal parts of
      the conversation I will write, as I recollect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our party being so small, he made all that passed general; for though he
      principally addressed himself to Mrs. Delany, he always looked round to
      see that we heard him, and frequently referred to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should mention, though, the etiquette always observed upon his entrance,
      which, first of all, is to fly off to distant quarters&mdash;and next,
      Miss Port goes out, walking backwards, for more candles, which she brings
      in, two at a time, and places upon the tables and pianoforte. Next she
      goes out for tea, which she then carries to his majesty, upon a large
      salver, containing sugar, cream, and bread and butter, and cake, while she
      hangs a napkin over her arm for his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he has taken his tea, she returns to her station, where she waits
      till he has done, and then takes away his cup, and fetches more. This, it
      seems, is a ceremony performed in other places always by the mistress of
      the house; but here neither of their majesties will permit Mrs. Delany to
      attempt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well; but to return. The king said he had just been looking over a new
      pamphlet, of Mr. Cumberland's, upon the character of Lord Sackville,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been asking Sir George Baker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if he had read it, and he
      told me, yes, but that he could not find out why Cumberland had written
      it. However, that, I think, I found out in the second page. For there he
      takes an opportunity to give a high character of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then enlarged more upon the subject, very frankly declaring in what
      points he differed from Mr. Cumberland about Lord Sackville; but as I
      neither knew him, nor had read the pamphlet, I could not at all enter into
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany then mentioned something of Madame de Genlis,<a
      href="#linknote-197" name="linknoteref-197" id="linknoteref-197">[197]</a>
      upon which the king eagerly said to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you saw her while she was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;did she speak English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely well, sir; with very great facility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? that always surprises me in a foreigner that has not lived here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her accent is foreign, however; but her language is remarkably ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then spoke of Voltaire, and talked a little of his works, concluding
      with this strong condemnation of their tendency:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;think him a monster, I own it fairly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody answered. Mrs. Delany did not quite hear him, and I knew too little
      of his works to have courage to say anything about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next named Rousseau, whom he seemed to think of with more favour,
      though by no means with approbation, Here, too, I had read too little to
      talk at all, though his majesty frequently applied to me. Mrs. Delany told
      several anecdotes which had come to her immediate knowledge of him while
      he was in England, at which time he had spent some days with her brother,
      Mr. Granville, at Calwich. The king, too, told others, which had come to
      his own ears, all charging him with savage pride and insolent ingratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, I ventured to interfere; for, as I knew he had had a
      pension from the king, I could not but wish his majesty should be informed
      he was grateful to him. And as you, my dear father, were my authority, I
      thought it but common justice to the memory of poor Rousseau to acquaint
      the king of his personal respect for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some gratitude, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he was not without. When my father was in
      Paris, which was after Rousseau had been in England, he visited him in his
      garret, and the first thing he showed him was your majesty's portrait over
      his chimney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king paused a little while upon this; but nothing more was said of
      Rousseau.
    </p>

    <h2>
      GEORGE III. ON PLAYS AND PLAYERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards, the king said he found by the newspapers, that Mrs.
      Clive<a href="#linknote-198" name="linknoteref-198" id="linknoteref-198">[198]</a>
      was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you read the newspapers? thought I. O, king! you must then have the
      most unvexing temper in the world, not to run wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led on to more players. He was sorry, he said, for Henderson,<a
      href="#linknote-199" name="linknoteref-199" id="linknoteref-199">[199]</a>
      and the more as Mrs. Siddons had wished to have him play at the same house
      with herself. Then Mrs. Siddons took her turn, and with the warmest
      praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an enthusiast for her,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;quite an enthusiast, I
      think there was never any player in my time so excellent&mdash;not Garrick
      himself&mdash;I own it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, coming close to me, who was silent, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;What? what?&rdquo;&mdash;meaning,
      what say you? But I still said nothing; I could not concur where I thought
      so differently, and to enter into an argument was quite impossible; for
      every little thing I said, the king listened to with an eagerness that
      made me always ashamed of its insignificancy. And, indeed, but for that I
      should have talked to him with much greater fluency, as well as ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      From players he went to plays, and complained of the great want of good
      modern comedies, and of the extreme immorality of most of the old ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they pretend,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;to mend them; but it is not possible. Do
      you think it is?&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not often, I believe;&mdash;the fault, commonly, lies in the
      very foundation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or they might mend the mere speeches&mdash;but the characters are
      all bad from the beginning to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he specified several; but I had read none of them, and consequently
      could say nothing about the matter&mdash;till, at last, he came to
      Shakspeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there ever,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;such stuff as great part of Shakspeare only
      one must not say so! But what think you?&mdash;What?&mdash;Is there not
      sad stuff? what?&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, I think so, sir, though mixed with such excellences, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O!&rdquo; cried he, laughing good-humouredly, &ldquo;I know it is not to be said! but
      it's true. Only it's Shakspeare, and nobody dare abuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he enumerated many of the characters and parts of plays that he
      objected to&mdash;and when he had run them over, finished with again
      laughing, and exclaiming,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one should be stoned for saying so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Genlis, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;had taken such an impression of the
      English theatre, that she told me she thought no woman ought to go to any
      of our comedies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, which, indeed, is a very overstrained censure of our dramas, made
      him draw back, and vindicate the stage from a sentence so severe; which,
      however, she had pronounced to me, as if she looked upon it to be an
      opinion in which I should join as a thing past dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king approved such a denunciation no more than his little subject; and
      he vindicated the stage from so hard an aspersion, with a warmth not
      wholly free from indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led on to a good deal more dramatic criticism; but what was said was
      too little followed up to be remembered for writing. His majesty stayed
      near two hours, and then wished Mrs. Delany good night, and having given
      me a bow, shut the door himself, to prevent Mrs. Delany, or even me, from
      attending him out, and, with only Miss Port to wait upon him, put on his
      own great coat in the passage, and walked away to the lower Lodge, to see
      the Princess Elizabeth, without carriage or attendant. He is a pattern of
      modest, but manly superiority to rank. I should say more of this evening,
      and of the king, with whose unaffected conversation and unassuming port
      and manner I was charmed, but that I have another meeting to write,&mdash;a
      long, and, to me, very delightful private conference with the queen. It
      happened the very next morning.

    <p>
      (I believe she knew my copy, which lay on the table.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I had taken it to Norbury, and meant to read it with Mrs. Locke,
      but things then prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! (looking pleased) have you read the last edition of her 'Adele?'&rdquo;<a
      href="#linknote-200" name="linknoteref-200" id="linknoteref-200">[200]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is much improved; for the passage, you know, Mrs. Delany, of the
      untruth, is all altered&mdash;fifteen pages are quite new; and she has
      altered it very prettily. She has sent it to me. She always sends me her
      works; she did it a long while ago, when I did not know there was such a
      lady as Madame de Genlis. You have not seen 'Adele,' then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would like to see it. But I have it not here. Indeed, I think
      sometimes I have no books at all, for they are at Kew, or they are in
      town, and they are here; and I don't know which is which. Is Madame de
      Genlis about any new work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am&mdash;-one which she intends 'pour le peuple.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that will be a good work. Have you heard of&mdash;&rdquo; (mentioning some
      German book, of which I forget the name).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it will be soon translated; very fine language,&mdash;very bad book.
      They translate all our worst! And they are so improved in language; they
      write so finely now, even for the most silly books, that it makes one read
      on, and one cannot help it. O, I am very angry sometimes at that! Do you
      like the 'Sorrows of Werter?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I have not read it, ma'am, only in part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Well, I don't know how it is translated, but it is very finely writ
      in German, and I can't bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very happy to hear that, for what I did look over made me determine
      never to read it. It seemed only writ as a deliberate defence of suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and what is worse, it is done by a bad man for revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then mentioned, with praise, another book, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew the translator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the translator knew that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;it is not&mdash;I should not like to give my name, for fear I
      have judged ill: I picked it up on a stall. O, it is amazing what good
      books there are on stalls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is amazing to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Delany, &ldquo;to hear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't pick them up myself; but I have a servant very clever; and
      if they are not to be had at the booksellers', they are not for me any
      more than for another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then spoke of Klopstock's &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; saying it contained four lines
      most perfect on religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I should like to see it. Is it translated?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Delany,
      turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In it,&rdquo; said her majesty: &ldquo;there is a story of Lazarus and the
      Centurion's daughter; and another young lady, Asyddel, he calls her; and
      Lazarus is in love;&mdash;a very pretty scene&mdash;no stopping;&mdash;but
      it is out of place;&mdash;I was quite angry to read it. And a long
      conversation between Christ and Lazarus&mdash;very strange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet Milton does that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN ON ROMAN CATHOLIC SUPERSTITIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And then she went on discussing Milton; this led to Wickliffe and Cranmer;
      and she spoke of the Roman Catholic superstitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, so odd! Can it signify to God Almighty if I eat a piece of fish or a
      piece of meat? And one of the Queen of France's sisters wears the heel of
      her shoe before for a penance; as if God Almighty could care for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is supposing in Him the caprice of a fine lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just so. Yet it is amusing, and pretty too, how sincere the lower
      people are, of the Catholics. I was with my mother at&mdash;a Catholic
      town, and there was a lady we knew, had a very bad tooth-ache; she
      suffered night and day, and we were very sorry. But, over the river there
      was a Virgin Mary of great fame for miracles, and, one morning, when I
      wanted to get up, our maid did not come, and nobody knew where she was,
      and she could not be found. At last she came back with a large bouquet,
      which she had carried over the river in the night and got it blessed, and
      gave it to the lady to cure her tooth-ache. But we have Protestant
      nunneries in Germany. I belonged to one which was under the Imperial
      protection; there is one for royal families&mdash;one for the noblesse,&mdash;the
      candidates' coats of arms are put up several weeks to be examined, and if
      any flaw is found, they are not elected. These nunneries are intended for
      young ladies of little fortunes and high birth. There is great licence in
      them. They have balls, not at home, but next door; and there is no
      restriction but to go to prayers at eight, at nine, and at night,&mdash;that
      is very little, you know,&mdash;and wear black or white, The dress
      consists of three caps, one over the forehead, one for the back, one up
      high, and one lower, for the veil; very pretty; and the gown is a vest,
      and the skirt has I don't know how many hundred plaits. I had the cross
      and order, but I believe I gave it away when I came to England&mdash;for
      you may transfer; so I gave it to the Countess of a friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help saying, how glad we all were that she was no nun!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I wanted to go to a chapel in that Catholic town,
      and my mother said I should go if I would be sure not to laugh at
      anything; and I promised I would not; so, I took care to keep my eyes half
      shut, half open, thus, for fear I should see something to make me laugh,
      for my mother told me I should not come out all day if I laughed. But
      there was nothing ridiculous.&rdquo;

      FANNY BURNEY TO MRS. BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Windsor, Dec. 17
    </h3>
    <p>
      My dearest Hetty,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry I could not more immediately write; but I really have not had a
      moment since your last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I know what you next want is, to hear accounts of kings, queens, and
      such royal personages. O ho! do you so? Well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I tell you a few matters of fact?&mdash;or, had you rather a few
      matters of etiquette? Oh, matters of etiquette, you cry! for matters of
      fact are short and stupid, and anybody can tell, and everybody is tired
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, take your own choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, then, with the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know I told you, in my last, my various difficulties, what sort of
      preferment to turn my thoughts to, and concluded with just starting a
      young budding notion of decision, by suggesting that a handsome pension
      for nothing at all would be as well as working night and day for a salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blossom of an idea, the more I dwelt upon, the more I liked. Thinking
      served it for a hothouse, and it came out into full blow as I ruminated
      upon my pillow. Delighted that thus all my contradictory and wayward
      fancies were overcome, and my mind was peaceably settled what to wish and
      to demand, I gave over all further meditation upon choice of elevation,
      and had nothing more to do but to make my election known.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next business, therefore, was to be presented. This could be no
      difficulty; my coming hither had been their own desire, and they had
      earnestly pressed its execution. I had only to prepare myself for the
      rencounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would never believe&mdash;you, who, distant from Courts and courtiers,
      know nothing of their ways&mdash;the many things to be studied, for
      appearing with a proper propriety before crowned heads. Heads without
      crowns are quite other sort of rotundas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, then, to the etiquette. I inquired into every particular, that no
      error might be committed. And as there is no saying what may happen in
      this mortal life, I shall give you those instructions I have received
      myself, that, should you find yourself in the royal presence, you may know
      how to comport yourself.

    <h2>
      DIRECTIONS FOR COUGHING, SNEEZING, OR MOVING BEFORE THE KING AND QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first place, you must not cough. If you find a cough tickling in
      your throat, you must arrest it from making any sound; if you find
      yourself choking with the forbearance, you must choke&mdash;but not cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, you must not sneeze. If you have a vehement cold, you
      must take no notice of it; if your nose membranes feel a great irritation,
      you must hold your breath; if a sneeze still insists upon making its way,
      you must oppose it, by keeping your teeth grinding together; if the
      violence of the repulse breaks some blood-vessel, you must break the
      blood-vessel&mdash;but not sneeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third place, you must not, upon any account, stir either hand or
      foot. If, by chance, a black pin runs into your head, you must not take it
      out. If the pain is very great, you must be sure to bear it without
      wincing; if it brings the tears into your eyes, you must not wipe them
      off; if they give you a tingling by running down your cheeks, you must
      look as if nothing was the matter. If the blood should gush from your head
      by means of the black pin, you must let it gush; if you are uneasy to
      think of making such a blurred appearance, you must be uneasy, but you
      must say nothing about it. If, however, the agony is very great, you may,
      privately, bite the inside of your cheek, or of your lips, for a little
      relief; taking care, meanwhile, to do it so cautiously as to make no
      apparent dent outwardly. And, with that precaution, if you even gnaw a
      piece out, it will not be minded, only be sure either to swallow it, or
      commit it to a corner of the inside of your mouth till they are gone&mdash;for
      you must not spit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have many other directions but no more paper; I will endeavour, however,
      to have them ready for you in time. Perhaps, meanwhile, you would be glad
      to know if I have myself had opportunity to put in practice these
      receipts?

    <h2>
      DR. BURNEY IS DISAPPOINTED OF A PLACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, May 21, 1786.</i>&mdash;I have now quite a new business to
      write upon. Late on Saturday night news reached my father of the death of
      the worthy Mr. Stanley, who has been long in a declining state of health.
      His place of master of the king's band my dear father had been promised
      formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was once more to apply for it; and early on Sunday morning he went
      to Mr. Smelt, to beg his advice what way to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was at the door, and going to church, my father returned, and
      desired me to come back, as he had something to communicate to me. Mr.
      Smelt, he then told me, had counselled him to go instantly to Windsor, not
      to address the king, but to be seen by him. &ldquo;Take your daughter,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;in your hand, and walk upon the Terrace. The king's seeing you at this
      time he will understand, and he is more likely to be touched by a hint of
      that delicate sort than by any direct application.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father determined implicitly to follow this advice. But let me not omit
      a singular little circumstance, which much enlivened and encouraged our
      expedition. While I was changing my dress for the journey, I received a
      letter from Miss Port, which was sent by a private hand, and ought to have
      arrived sooner, and which pressed my visit to my dear Mrs. Delany very
      warmly, and told me it was by the queen's express wish. This gave me great
      spirits for my dear father's enterprise, and I was able to help him on the
      road, from so favourable a symptom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got to Windsor, my father saw me safe to Mrs. Delany's, and then
      went himself to Dr. Lind's. With what joy did I fly into the dear, open
      arms of this most venerable of women! Her reception had all the warm
      liveliness of pleasant surprise, added to its unfailing kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Port, with her usual partiality, was in high glee from the surprise.
      I dined and drank tea with them. Mrs. Delany related to me the most
      flattering speech made to her by the queen, about my coming to her as &ldquo;the
      friend best suited to solace her in her disturbances,&rdquo; and assured me she
      had quite interested herself in pressing Mrs. Delany to hasten me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis very extraordinary what a gracious disposition towards me this sweet
      queen always manifests, and what peculiar elegance there is in the
      expressions she makes use of in my favour. They were now particularly
      well-timed, and gave me most pleasant hopes for my dear father. He came to
      tea at Mrs. Delany's, and, at the proper hour, went to the Terrace, with
      the good-natured Dr. Lind, who is always ready to oblige. I waited to go
      with a female party, which was arranged for me by Mrs. Delany, and soon
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the royal family were already on the Terrace before we arrived. The
      king and queen, and the Prince of Mecklenburg, and her majesty's mother&mdash;walked
      together. Next them the princesses and their ladies, and the young
      princesses, making a very gay and pleasing procession, of one of the
      finest families in the world. Every way they moved, the crowd retired to
      stand up against the wall as they passed, and then closed in to follow.
      When they approached towards us, and we were retreating, Lady Louisa
      Clayton placed me next herself, making her daughters stand below&mdash;a
      politeness and attention without which I had certainly not been seen; for
      the moment their majesties advanced, I involuntarily looked down, and drew
      my hat over my face. I could not endure to stare at them, and, full of our
      real errand, I felt ashamed, even of being seen by them. The very idea of
      a design, however far from illaudable is always distressing and
      uncomfortable. Consequently, I should have stood in the herd, and
      unregarded; but Lady Louisa's kindness and good breeding put me in a place
      too conspicuous to pass unnoticed. The moment the queen had spoken to her,
      which she stopped to do as soon as she came up to her, she inquired, in a
      whisper, who was with her; as I know by hearing my own name given for the
      answer. The queen then instantly stepped nearer me, and asked me how I
      did; and then the king came forward, and, as soon as he had repeated the
      same question, said, &ldquo;Are you come to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but how long shall you stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go to-night, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure,&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;she was not come to stay, by seeing her
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad by this to know my father had been observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when did you come?&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two hours ago, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when do you return again to Windsor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon, I hope, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; cried he, half laughing, and hesitating,
      significantly, &ldquo;pray, how goes on the Muse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first I only laughed, too; but he repeated the inquiry, and then I
      answered, &ldquo;Not at all, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? But why?&mdash;why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I am afraid sir,&rdquo; stammered I, and true enough, I am
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; repeated he, &ldquo;of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke something,&mdash;I hardly know what myself,&mdash;so indistinctly,
      that he could not hear me, though he had put his head quite under my hat,
      from the beginning of the little conference and, after another such
      question or two, and no greater satisfaction in the answer, he smiled very
      good humouredly, and walked on, his charming queen by his side. His
      condescension confuses, though it delights me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stayed some time longer on the Terrace, and my poor father occasionally
      joined me; but he looked so conscious and depressed, that it pained me to
      see him. There is nothing that I know so very dejecting, as solicitation.
      I am sure I could never, I believe, go through a task of that sort. My
      dear father was not spoken to, though he had a bow every time the king
      passed him, and a curtsey from the queen. But it hurt him, and he thought
      it a very bad prognostic; and all there was at all to build upon was the
      graciousness shewn to me, which, indeed, in the manner I was accosted, was
      very flattering, and, except to high rank, I am told, very rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stayed but a very short time with my sweet Mrs. Delany, whose best
      wishes you are sure were ours. I told her our plan, and our full
      conviction that she could not assist in it; as the obligations she herself
      owes are so great and so weighty, that any request from her would be
      encroaching and improper.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not get home till past eleven o'clock. We were then informed that
      Lord Brudenel had called to say Mr. Parsons had a promise of the place
      from the lord chamberlain. This was not very exhilarating.

    <h2>
      A VISIT TO WARREN HASTINGS AND HIS WIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had been invited by Mr. Cambridge to pass a day at Twickenham with Mr.
      and Mrs. Hastings, who had proposed to carry me with them: accordingly, on
      May 24th, Mrs. Hastings sent her carriage here before ten o'clock. I made
      her and Mr. Hastings a visit of about half an hour previously to our
      journey. I am quite charmed with Mr. Hastings, and, indeed, from all I can
      gather, and all I can observe,&mdash;both which are but little,&mdash;he
      appears to me to be one of the greatest men now living, as a public
      character; while as a private one, his gentleness, candour, soft manners,
      and openness of disposition, make him one of the most pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little journey was extremely agreeable. He spoke with the utmost
      frankness of his situation and affairs, and with a noble confidence in his
      certainty of victory over his enemies, from his consciousness of integrity
      and honour, that filled me with admiration and esteem for him. Mrs.
      Hasting's is lively, obliging, and entertaining, and so adored by her
      husband, that, in her sight and conversation he seems to find a
      recompense, adequate to all his wishes, for the whole of his toils, and
      long disturbances and labours. How rare, but how sweet and pleasant, the
      sight of such unions.

    <h2>
      A PROPOSAL FROM THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [June, 1786.-A vacancy at this time occurred in the royal
     household, from the resignation of Madame Haggerdorn, one of
     the queen's German attendants who, together with Madame
     Schwellenberg, held the office of keeper of the robes.  The
     place was much sought after, but her majesty had been so
     well pleased with what she saw of Miss Burney, that she
     graciously empowered Mr. Smelt to offer her this situation,
     allowing her time to consider and weigh its advantages.

     Miss Burney, though deeply grateful for such a distinction,
     foresaw with alarm the separation from her family and the
     total confinement it would occasion; and, in her perplexity
     how to decide, she wrote to her friend, Miss Cambridge, in
     the following terms.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, June, 1786.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Yesterday evening, while I was with Mrs. Delany, Mr. Smelt arrived
      from Windsor, and desired a private conference with her; and, when it was
      over, a separate one with me: surprising me not a little, by entreating me
      to suffer some very home questions from him, relative to my situation, my
      views, and even my wishes, with respect to my future life. At first, I
      only laughed: but my merriment a little failed, me, when he gave me to
      understand he was commissioned to make these inquiries by a great
      personage, who had conceived so favourable an opinion of me as to be
      desirous of undoubted information, whether or not there was a probability
      she might permanently attach me to herself and her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot easily, my dear Miss Cambridge, picture to yourself the
      consternation with which I received this intimation. It was such that the
      good and kind Mr. Smelt, perceiving it, had the indulgence instantly to
      offer me his services, first, in forbearing to mention even to my father
      his commission, and next in fabricating and carrying back for me a
      respectful excuse. And I must always consider myself the more obliged to
      him, as I saw in his own face the utmost astonishment and disappointment
      at this reception of his embassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not, however, reconcile to myself concealing from my dear father a
      matter that ought to be settled by himself; yet I frankly owned to Mr.
      Smelt that no situation of that sort was suited to my own taste, or
      promising to my own happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed equally sorry and surprised; he expatiated warmly upon the
      sweetness of character of all the royal family, and then begged me to
      consider the very peculiar distinction shown me, that, unsolicited,
      unsought, I had been marked out with such personal favour by the queen
      herself, as a person with whom she had been so singularly pleased, as to
      wish to settle me with one of the princesses, in preference to the
      thousands of offered candidates, of high birth and rank, but small
      fortunes, who were waiting and supplicating for places in the new-forming
      establishment. Her majesty proposed giving me apartments in the palace;
      making me belong to the table of Mrs. Schwellenberg, with whom all her own
      visitors&mdash;bishops, lords, or commons&mdash;always dine; keeping me a
      footman, and settling on me 200 pounds a year. &ldquo;And in such a situation,&rdquo;
       he added, &ldquo;so respectably offered, not solicited, you may have
      opportunities of serving your particular friends,&mdash;especially your
      father,&mdash;such as scarce any other could afford you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My dear Miss Cambridge will easily feel that this was a plea not to be
      answered. Yet the attendance upon this princess was to be incessant,&mdash;the
      confinement to the court continual; I was scarce ever to be spared for a
      single visit from the palaces, nor to receive anybody but with permission,&mdash;and,
      my dear Miss Cambridge, what a life for me, who have friends so dear to
      me, and to whom friendship is the balm, the comfort, the very support of
      existence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't think me ungrateful, meanwhile, to the sweet queen, for thus
      singling out and distinguishing an obscure and most unambitious
      individual. No indeed, I am quite penetrated with her partial and most
      unexpected condescension; but yet, let me go through, for her sake, my
      tasks with what cheerfulness I may, the deprivations I must suffer would
      inevitably keep me from all possibility of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I said but little, my dear Mrs. Delany was disturbed and good Mr.
      Smelt much mortified, that a proposition which had appeared to them the
      most flattering and honourable, should be heard only with dejection. I
      cast, however, the whole into my father's disposal and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have time for no more detail, than merely to say, that till the
      offer comes in form, no positive answer need be given, and therefore that
      I am yet at liberty. Write to me, then, my dearest Miss Cambridge, with
      all your fullest honesty, and let me know which you wish to strengthen&mdash;my
      courage in making my real sentiments openly known, or my fortitude in
      concealing what it may be right I should endure....
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monday Night,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now to add, that the zealous Mr. Smelt is just returned from
      Windsor, whither he went again this morning, purposely to talk the matter
      over with her majesty. What passed I know not,&mdash;but the result is,
      that she has desired an interview with me herself; it is to take place
      next Monday, at Windsor. I now see the end&mdash;I see it next to
      inevitable. I can suggest nothing upon earth that I dare say for myself,
      in an audience so generously meant. I cannot even to my father utter my
      reluctance,&mdash;I see him so much delighted at the prospect of an
      establishment he looks upon as so honourable. But for the queen's own word
      &ldquo;permanent,&rdquo;&mdash;but for her declared desire to attach me entirely to
      herself and family!&mdash;I should share in his pleasure; but what can
      make me amends for all I shall forfeit? But I must do the best I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write me a comforting and strengthening letter, my dearest Miss Cambridge.
      I have no heart to write to Mickleham, or Norbury. I know how they will
      grieve:&mdash;they have expected me to spend the whole summer with them.
      My greatest terror is, lest the queen, from what Mr. Smelt hinted, should
      make me promise myself to her for a length of years. What can I do to
      avoid that? Anything that has a period is endurable but what can I object
      that will not sound ungrateful, to the honour she is doing me and meaning
      me? She has given the most highly flattering reasons for making this
      application, in preference to listening to that of others; she has put it
      upon terms of commendation the most soothing; she is, indeed, one of the
      sweetest characters in the world. Will you, too, condemn me, then, that I
      feel thus oppressed by her proposal? I hope not,&mdash;I think not;&mdash;but
      be very honest if you really do. I wish I could see you! It is not from
      nervousness;&mdash;I have always and uniformly had a horror of a life of
      attendance and dependence....

     [How Miss Cambridge replied is not known; but Miss Burney's
     appreciation of the queen's kindness, and the desire avowed
     by Dr. Burney and Mrs. Delany that so honourable and
     advantageous an offer should not be declined, induced her to

    <h2>
      FANNY BURNEY TO DR. BURNEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, June 19.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      How great must have been your impatience, dearest sir but my interview has
      only this morning taken place. Everything is settled, and to-morrow
      morning I go to the queen's Lodge, to see the apartments, and to receive
      my instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must confess myself extremely frightened and full of alarms at a change
      of situation so great, so unexpected, so unthought-of. Whether I shall
      suit it or not, heaven only knows, but I have a thousand doubts. Yet
      nothing could be sweeter than the queen,&mdash;more encouraging, more
      gentle, or more delicate. She did not ask me one question concerning my
      qualifications for the charge; she only said, with the most condescending
      softness, &ldquo;I am sure, Miss Burney, we shall suit one another very well.&rdquo;
       And, another time, &ldquo;I am sure we shall do very well together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And what is it, dear Sir, you suppose to be my business? Not to attend any
      of the princesses&mdash;but the queen herself! This, indeed, was a
      delightful hearing, reverencing and admiring her as I have so sincerely
      done ever since I first saw her. And in this, my amazement is proportioned
      to my satisfaction; for the place designed me is that of Mrs. Haggerdorn,
      who came with her from Germany, and it will put me more immediately and
      more constantly in her presence than any other place, but that of Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, in the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prepossession the queen has taken in my favour is truly extraordinary,
      for it seems as if her real view was, as Mr. Smelt hinted, to attach me to
      her person. She has been long, she told Mrs. Delany, looking out for one
      to supply the place of Mrs. Haggerdorn, whose ill health forces her back
      to Germany; &ldquo;and I was led to think of Miss Burney, first by her books;
      then by seeing her&mdash;then by always hearing how she was loved by her
      friends; but chiefly by your friendship for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fancy my appointment will take place very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Windsor, June 20.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure you will be glad to hear I have got one formality over, that was
      very disagreeable to my expectations. I have been introduced to Mrs.
      Haggerdorn whom I am to succeed, and to Mrs. Schwellenberg, whom I am to
      accompany. This passed at the queen's Lodge, in their own apartments, this
      morning. I cannot easily describe the sensation with which I entered that
      dwelling,&mdash;the thoughts of its so soon becoming my habitation,&mdash;and
      the great hazard of how all will go on in it&mdash;and the sudden change!
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was perfectly civil and easy; the queen had herself prepared
      them to receive me, and requested me to go. They made no use of the
      meeting in the way of business it was merely a visit of previous
      ceremony....
    </p>
    <p>
      The utmost astonishment will take place throughout the Court when they
      hear of my appointment. Everybody has settled some successor to Mrs.
      Haggerdorn; and I have never, I am very sure, been suspected by a single
      person. I saw, this morning, by all that passed with Mrs. S., how
      unexpected a step her majesty has taken. The place, she told me, has been
      solicited, distantly, by thousands and thousands of women of fashion and
      rank....

    </p>
    <p>
      ... Her majesty has sent me a message, express, near a fortnight ago, with
      an offer of a place at Court, to succeed Mrs. Haggerdorn, one of the
      Germans who accompanied her to England, and who is now retiring into her
      own country. 'Tis a place of being constantly about her own person, and
      assisting in her toilette,&mdash;a place of much confidence, and many
      comforts; apartments in the palace; a footman kept for me; a coach in
      common with Mrs. Schwellenberg; 200 pounds a-year, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been in a state of extreme disturbance ever since, from the
      reluctance I feel to the separation it will cause me from all my friends.
      Those, indeed, whom I most love, I shall be able to invite to me in the
      palace&mdash;-but I see little or no possibility of being able to make
      what I most value, excursions into the country.... I repine at losing my
      loved visits to Mickleham, Norbury, Chesington, Twickenham, and Ayle sham;
      all these I must now forego....
    </p>
    <p>
      You may believe how much I am busied. I have been presented at the queen's
      Lodge in Windsor, and seen Mrs. Haggerdorn in office, and find I have a
      place of really nothing to do, but to attend; and on Thursday I am
      appointed by her majesty to go to St. James's, to see all that belongs to
      me there. And I am now &ldquo;fitting out&rdquo; just as you were, and all the maids
      and workers suppose I am going to be married, and snigger every time they
      bring in any of my new attire. I do not care to publish the affair till it
      is made known by authority; so I leave them to their conjectures, and I
      fancy their greatest wonder is, who and where is the sposo; for they must
      think it odd he should never appear!

      THE QUEEN'S SUMMONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Queen's Lodge, Windsor, Monday, July 17</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With what hurry of mind and body did I rise this morning! Everything had
      already been arranged for Mrs. Ord's carrying us to Windsor, and my
      father's carriage was merely to go as baggage-waggon for my clothes. But I
      wept not then. I left no one behind me to regret; my dear father
      accompanied me, and all my dear sisters had already taken their flight,
      never more to return. Even poor little Sarah.<a href="#linknote-203"
       name="linknoteref-203" id="linknoteref-203">[203]</a> whom I love very
      dearly, was at Chesington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between nine and ten o'clock we set off. We changed carriage in Queen
      Ann-street, and Mrs. Ord conveyed us thence to Windsor. With a struggling
      heart, I kept myself tolerably tranquil during the little journey. My dear
      father was quite happy, and Mrs. Ord felt the joy of a mother in
      relinquishing me to the protection of a queen so universally reverenced.
      Had I been in better spirits, their ecstasy would have been unbounded; but
      alas!&mdash;what I was approaching was not in my mind&mdash;what I was
      leaving had taken Possession of it solely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Port flew out to us as the carriage stopped&mdash;the youthful blush
      of pleasure heightening her complexion, and every feature shewing her kind
      happiness. Mrs. Delany, she said, was gone out with the queen. I took
      leave of my good Mrs. Ord, whose eyes overflowed with maternal feelings&mdash;chiefly
      of contentment. Mrs. Delany came home in about an hour. A chastened
      satisfaction was hers; she rejoiced in the prospect before me; she was
      happy we should now be so much united, but she felt for my deprivations,
      she saw the hard conflict within me, and the tenderest pity checked her
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now debated whether I was immediately to go to the Lodge, or wait
      for orders. The accustomed method for those who have their majesties'
      commands to come to them is, to present themselves to the people in
      waiting, and by them to be announced. My heart, however, was already
      sinking, and my spirits every moment were growing more agitated, and my
      sweet Mrs. Delany determined to spare me the additional task of passing
      through such awe-striking formalities. She therefore employed my dear
      father&mdash;delighted with the employment&mdash;to write a note, in her
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Delany presents her most humble duty to the queen; she found Dr.
      Burney and his daughter at her house. Miss Burney waits the honour of her
      majesty's commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, though unceremonious and unusual, she was sure the queen would
      pardon. A verbal answer came that I was to go to the Lodge immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, my dear Susan! in what an agony of mind did I obey the summons! I was
      still in my travelling dress, but could not stay to change it. My father
      accompanied me. Mrs. Delany, anxiously and full of mixed sensations, gave
      me her blessing. We walked; the queen's Lodge is not fifty yards from Mrs.
      Delany's door. My dear father's own courage all failed him in this little
      step; for as I was now on the point of entering&mdash;probably for ever&mdash;into
      an entire new way of life, and of foregoing by it all my most favourite
      schemes, and every dear expectation my fancy had ever indulged of
      happiness adapted to its taste&mdash;as now all was to be given up&mdash;I
      could disguise my trepidation no longer&mdash;indeed I never had
      disguised, I had only forborne proclaiming it. But my dear father now,
      sweet soul! felt it all, as I held by his arm, without power to say one
      word, but that if he did not hurry along I should drop by the way. I heard
      in his kind voice that he was now really alarmed; he would have slackened
      his pace, or have made me stop to breathe; but I could not; my breath
      seemed gone, and I could only hasten with all my might, lest my strength
      should go too.
    </p>
    <p>
      A page was in waiting at the gate, who shewed us into Mrs. Haggerdorn's
      room, which was empty. My dear father endeavoured here to compose my
      spirits; I could have no other command over them than to forbear letting
      him know the afflicted state of all within, and to suffer him to keep to
      his own conclusions, that my emotion was all from fear of the approaching
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page came in a minute or two to summon me to the queen. The queen was
      in her dressing-room. Mrs. Schwellenberg was standing behind her: nobody
      else present.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received me with a most gracious bow of the head, and a smile that was
      all sweetness. She saw me much agitated, and attributed it, no doubt, to
      the awe of her presence. O, she little knew my mind had no room in it for
      feelings of that sort! She talked to me of my journey, my father, my
      sisters, and my brothers; the weather, the roads, and Mrs. Delany, any,
      every thing she could suggest, that could best tend to compose and to make
      me easy; and when I had been with her about a quarter of an hour, she
      desired Mrs. Schwellenberg to shew me my apartment, and, with another
      graceful bow, motioned my retiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only to the sweet queen, but to myself let me here do justice, in
      declaring that though I entered her presence with a heart filled with
      everything but herself, I quitted it with sensations much softened. The
      condescension of her efforts to quiet me, and the elegance of her
      receiving me, thus, as a visitor, without naming to me a single direction,
      without even the most distant hint of business, struck me to shew so much
      delicacy, as well as graciousness, that I quitted her with a very deep
      sense of her goodness, and a very strong conviction that she merited every
      exertion on my part to deserve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg left me,&mdash;at the room door, where my dear father
      was still waiting for me, too anxious to depart till he again saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent a short time together, in which I assured him I would from that
      moment take all the happiness in my power, and banish all the regret. I
      told him how gratifying had been my reception, and I omitted nothing I
      could think of to remove the uneasiness that this day seemed first to
      awaken in him, thank God! I had the fullest success; his hopes and gay
      expectations were all within call, and they ran back at the first
      beckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This settled, and his dear countenance all fresh illumined with returning
      content, we went together to Mrs. Schwellenherg, where we made a visit of
      about an hour, in which I had the pleasure of seeing them upon very
      amicable terms; and then we had one more tete-a-tete all in the same
      cheering style, and he left me to drest, and went to dine with Mrs.
      Delany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to myself, I did not dare stop to think, nor look round upon my new
      abode, nor consider for how long I was taking possession; I rang for my
      new maid, and immediately dressed for dinner. I now took the most vigorous
      resolutions to observe the promise I had made my dear father. Now all was
      filially settled, to borrow my own words, I needed no monitor to tell me
      it would be foolish, useless, even wicked, not to reconcile myself to my
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The many now wishing for just the same&mdash;O! could they look within me.
      I am married, my dearest Susan&mdash;I look upon it in that light&mdash;I
      was averse to forming the union, and I endeavoured to escape it; but my
      friends interfered&mdash;they prevailed&mdash;and the knot is tied. What
      then now remains but to make the best wife in my power? I am bound to it
      in duty, and I will strain every nerve to succeed.

    <h2>
      A MILITARY GOURMAND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When summoned to dinner, I found Mrs. Schwellenberg and a German officer,
      Colonel Polier, who is now an attendant of Prince Charles of Mecklenburg,
      the queen's brother, who is on a visit to their majesties. I was
      introduced to him and we took our places. I was offered the seat of Mrs.
      Haggerdorn, which was at the head of the table; but that was an
      undertaking I could not bear. I begged leave to decline it; and as Mrs.
      Schwellenberg left me at my own choice, I planted myself quietly at one
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Polier, though a German officer, is of a Swiss family.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a fat, good-humoured man, excessively fond Of eating and drinking.
      His enjoyment of some of the fare, and especially of the dessert, was
      really laughable; he could never finish a speech he had begun, if a new
      dish made its appearance, without stopping to feast his eyes upon it,
      exclaim something in German, and suck the inside of his mouth; but all so
      openly, and with such perfect good-humour, that it was diverting without
      anything distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner we went upstairs into Mrs. Schwellenberg's room, to drink
      coffee. This is a daily practice. Her rooms are exactly over mine; they
      are the same size, and have the same prospect, but they are much more
      sumptuously fitted up.

    <h2>
      A SUCCESSION OF VISITORS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colonel Polier soon left us, to attend Prince Charles. Mrs. Schwellenberg
      and I had then a long tete-a-tete, in which I found her a woman of
      understanding, and fond of conversation. I was called down afterwards to
      Miss Port, who was eager to see me in my new dwelling, and dying with
      impatience to know, hear, and examine everything about me. She ran about
      to make all the inquiries and discoveries she could for me, and was so
      highly delighted with my situation, it was impossible not to receive some
      pleasure even from looking at her. She helped me to unpack, to arrange, to
      do everything that came in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time Madame de la Fite entered, nearly as impatient as herself
      to be my first visitor. She was quite fanciful and entertaining about my
      succeeding to Mrs. Haggerdorn, and repeatedly turned round to look at me
      fresh and fresh, to see if it was really me, and me in that so long
      differently appropriated apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had but just left me, when who should enter but my dear Mrs. Delany
      herself. This was indeed a sweet regale to me. She came to welcome me in
      my own apartment, and I am sure to teach me to love it. What place could I
      see her in and hate? I could hardly do anything but kiss her soft cheeks,
      and dear venerable hands, with gratitude for her kindness, while she
      stayed with me, which was till the royal family came home from the
      Terrace, which they walk upon every fine evening. She had already been
      invited to the king's concert, which she then attended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Port and I now planned that we would drink together. It was, indeed,
      my dearest Mrs. Locke's injunctions that determined me upon making that
      trial; for I knew nothing could more contribute to my future chance of
      some happy hours than securing this time and this repast to myself. Mrs.
      Delany had the same wish, and encouraged me in the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I knew not to whom to speak, nor how to give a positive order, in my
      ignorance whether the measure I desired to take was practicable or not,
      Miss Port undertook to be my agent. She therefore ran out, and scampered
      up and down the stairs and passages in search of some one to whom she
      could apply. She met at last Mrs. Schwellenberg's man, and boldly bid him
      &ldquo;bring Miss Burney's tea.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is ready,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;in the dining
      parlour.&rdquo; And then he came to me, with his mistress's compliments, and
      that she was come down to tea, and waited for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To refuse to go was impossible it would have been an opening so offensive,
      with a person destined for my principal companion, and who had herself
      begun very civilly and attentively, that I could not even hesitate. I only
      felt heavy-hearted, and Miss Port made a thousand faces, and together we
      went to the eating-room.

    <h2>
      THE TEA TABLE OF THE KEEPER OF THE ROBES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg had already made the tea; and four gentlemen were
      seated at the table. The Bishop of Salisbury, as I afterwards found he
      was, came up to congratulate me, and spoke very kindly of my father, whom
      he said he had just seen on the Terrace. This is a brother of Lord
      Barrington's: I had never met him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next him sat a young clergyman, Mr. Fisher, whom I did not recollect, but
      who said he had seen me once at Mrs. Ord's, and spoke to me of her, and of
      Mrs. Thrale, whom he had lately left in Italy, where he has been
      travelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And next was Major Price, the equerry of the king at present in waiting.
      He is the same that all the Barborne family so adored when a captain. He
      mentioned them all to me, with high praise and great good-breeding. I am
      very much pleased with him, and happy he should be the equerry in waiting
      on my first arrival. Colonel Polier was also of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find it has always belonged to Mrs. Schwellenberg and Mrs. Haggerdorn to
      receive at tea whatever company the king or queen invite to the Lodge, as
      it is only a very select few of them that can eat with their majesties,
      and those few are only ladies; no men, of what rank soever, being
      permitted to sit in the queen's presence. I mean and hope to leave this
      business wholly to Mrs. Schwellenberg, and only to succeed Mrs. Haggerdorn
      in personal attendance upon the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      During tea the door opened, and a young lady entered, upon whose
      appearance all the company rose, and retreated a few paces backward, with
      looks of high respect. She advanced to Mrs. Schwellenberg, and desired her
      to send a basin of tea into the music-room for Mrs. Delany: then walking
      up to me, with a countenance of great sweetness, she said, &ldquo;I hope you are
      very well, Miss Burney?&rdquo; I only curtseyed, and knew not till she left the
      room, which was as soon as she had spoken a few words to Major Price, that
      this was the Princess Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the concert began; the band being very full, and the
      performance on the ground-floor, as is the eating-room. I heard it perhaps
      better, because softer, than if I had been in the music-room. I was very
      glad of this circumstance. Nothing was played but Handel; but I was
      pleased to hear any music, so much had I persuaded myself I should hear no
      more.

    <h2>
      EVENING CEREMONIAL IN THE QUEEN'S DRESSING ROOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At night I was summoned to the queen's apartment. Mrs. Schwellenberg was
      there, waiting. We sat together some time. The queen then arrived, handed
      into her dressing-room by the king, and followed by the princess royal and
      Princess Augusta. None other of the princesses slept in the queen's Lodge.
      The lower Lodge, which is at the further end of the garden, is the
      dwelling-place of the four younger princesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, with a marked appearance of feeling for the&mdash;no doubt
      evident&mdash;embarrassment of my situation, on their entrance, with a
      mild good-breeding inquired of me how I had found Mrs. Delany: and then,
      kissing both his daughters, left the room. The two princesses each took
      the queen's hand, which they respectfully kissed, and wishing her good
      night, curtseyed condescendingly to her new attendant, and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen spoke to me a little of my father, my journey, and Mrs. Delany,
      and then entered into easy conversation, in German, with Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, who never speaks English but by necessity. I had no sort of
      employment given me. The queen was only waited upon by Mrs. Schwellenberg
      and Mrs. Thielky, her wardrobe woman; and when she had put on her night
      dishabille, she wished me good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      This consideration to the perturbed state of my mind, that led her majesty
      to permit my presence merely as a spectatress, by way of taking a lesson
      of my future employment for my own use, though to her, doubtless,
      disagreeable, was extremely gratifying to me, and sent me to bed with as
      much ease as I now could hope to find.

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN'S TOILETTES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, July 8.</i>&mdash;I rose at six, and was called to the queen
      soon after seven. Only Mrs. Schwellenberg was with her, and again she made
      me a mere looker-on; and the obligation I felt to her sent me somewhat
      lighter hearted from her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was dressed, in a simple morning gown, she had her hat and cloak
      put on, to go to prayers at eight o'clock, at the king's chapel in the
      Castle; and I returned to my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon came my dear father, and spent an hour or two with me&mdash;so
      happy! so contented! so big with every pleasant expectation!&mdash;I
      rejoice to recollect that I did nothing, said nothing this morning to
      check his satisfaction; it was now, suddenly and at once, all my care to
      increase his delight. And so henceforward it must invariably continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      We parted cheerfully on both sides; yet I saw a little pang in his last
      embrace, and felt it in his dear hands:&mdash;but I kept myself well up,
      and he left me, I really believe, without a wish ungratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dressing-time the same quiet conduct was still observed by the queen&mdash;fixed
      in her benign determination to permit me to recover breath and ease, ere
      she gave me any other trial than merely standing in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner we&mdash;I mean Mrs. Schwellenberg and myself&mdash;had Miss
      Planta and Colonel Polier; and I was happy to be again diverted with the
      excess of his satisfaction at sight of turtle upon the table.

    <h2>
      CONGRATULATORY VISITS FROM COURT OFFICIALS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening I had a visit from Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave, who brought
      her sister, Lady Caroline Waldegrave, both to pay congratulatory
      compliments. Lady Elizabeth is lady of the bedchamber to the princess
      royal, and lives in this Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister, by the queen's, goodness, is permitted to spend some months of
      every year with her. They were left orphans at about sixteen: the queen
      instantly took them both under her protection. They are gentle and well
      bred, and seem very amiable. They stayed with me till it was time for them
      to go into waiting for the princess royal, whom they attend to the
      Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest Mrs. Delany came again, to visit me wholly, and drink tea with
      me. We had a thousand things to discuss, but were scarce a moment together
      before we were interrupted by Madame de la Fite, who, however, only stayed
      to give and receive from Mrs. Delany congratulations on meeting in my room
      at Windsor, and then she pretty soon took leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had but again arranged ourselves to a little comfort, when a tat-tat at
      my door followed, and a lady entered whom I had never seen before, with a
      very courteous air and demeanour, saying, &ldquo;I could not defer paying my
      compliments to Miss Burney, and wishing her much joy, which we must all
      feel in such an accession to our society: I must get my daughter to
      introduce me.&rdquo; And then advanced Mrs. Fielding, and I found this was Lady
      Charlotte Finch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fielding is one of the women of the bedchamber. She lives with her
      mother, Lady Charlotte, and her three daughters, girls from ten to fifteen
      years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she also wished me joy, I saw in her face a strong mark of still
      remaining astonishment at my appointment. Indeed all the people in office
      here are so evidently amazed that one so unthought of amongst them should
      so unexpectedly fill a place to which they had all privately appropriated
      some acquaintance, that I see them with difficulty forbear exclaiming,
      &ldquo;How odd it is to see you here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte's visit was short and very civil; she was obliged to hasten
      to the Castle, to attend the younger princesses till they went to the
      Terrace. They are sent to wait in an apartment of the Castle, till the
      king and queen and the elders walk out, and then they are called to join
      them, when the crowd is not great, and when the weather is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Windsor apartment is extremely comfortable. I have a large
      drawing-room, as they call it, which is on the ground floor, as are all
      the queen's rooms, and which faces the Castle and the venerable round
      tower, and opens at the further side, from the windows, to the little
      park. It is airy, pleasant, clean, and healthy, My bed-room is small, but
      neat and comfortable; its entrance is only from the drawing-room, and it
      looks to the garden. These two rooms are delightfully independent of all
      the rest of the house, and contain everything I can desire for my
      convenience and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her way to my room, Mrs. Delany had met the king; she was a little
      shocked, and feared she came at an improper hour, or ought to have come in
      the back way. I know not if he had perceived her distress; but he soon
      removed It, for when he went out to go to the Terrace he looked towards my
      windows, and seeing her there, advanced a few steps to ask her how she
      did. The queen turned round and curtseyed to her, and the Princess Augusta
      ran up to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had retired behind her; but when they moved on, Miss Goldsworthy, the
      sub-governess, stole from her charges, and came to the window to desire
      Mrs. Delany to introduce' her to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet Mrs. Delany, thwarted in her kind private views of an interesting
      confabulation, grew fatigued, and went home; and then Mrs. Fielding rose
      to accompany her. Miss Port made a second attempt for tea, but received
      for answer that Mrs. Schwellenberg would come down and make it as soon as
      the king and queen came from the Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony of waiting tea till the royal family return from the Terrace,
      is in order to make it for any company they may invite to it....
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, like the rest of my attendance, I was merely treated as if an
      accidental visitor. Sweet queen&mdash;she seems as fearful of employing me
      as I am myself of being employed.

    <h2>
      INOPPORTUNE VISITORS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>July 20.</i>&mdash;This morning the queen enquired of me if I loved
      walking? I answered yes; and she then told me I had better not leave off
      that exercise, but walk out every morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called at my dear Mrs. Delany's, and took Miss Port with me. We went
      together to Lady Louisa Clayton. We next went to Lady Charlotte Finch, who
      is one of her sisters, and governess to the princesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called also at Madame de la Fite's; but she was so urgent with me to
      prolong my stay, that I returned too late to dress for my noon attendance,
      and just as I was in the midst of my hair dishevelling, I was summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to slip on my morning gown, and a large morning cap, and run
      away as fast as possible. The queen, who was only preparing for her own
      hair-dresser, was already en peignoir: she sat down, the man was called
      in, and then, looking at me with a smile, she said &ldquo;Now, Miss Burney, you
      may go and finish your dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away I gallopped as fast as possible, to be ready against her hair-dresser
      departed: but when I came pretty near my own apartment, I was stopped in
      the gallery by a lady, who coming up to me, said &ldquo;Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started and looked at her; but finding her a perfect stranger to me, I
      only said &ldquo;Ma'am!&rdquo;&mdash;and my accent of surprise made her beg my pardon
      and walk on. I was too much in haste to desire any explanation, and was
      only quickening my pace, when I was again stopped by a gentleman with a
      star and red ribbon, who, bowing very civilly, said &ldquo;Miss Burney, I
      presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&mdash;&rdquo; was again all my answer and again, like the lady, he begged
      my pardon, and retreated and I was too seriously earnest to pursue my
      business to dare lose a moment. On, therefore, I again hurried; but, at
      the very door of my room, which is three steps down and three up place out
      of the even line of the gallery, I was once more stopped, by a very fat
      lady: who, coming up to me, also said &ldquo;Miss Burney, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;been to wait upon you,&mdash;but I could find
      nobody to introduce me; I believe I must introduce myself,&mdash;Lady
      Effingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her for the honour she did me,&mdash;but when she proposed
      returning with me to my room, in order to finish her visit, I was quite
      disconcerted; and hesitated so much that she said &ldquo;Perhaps it is not
      convenient to you?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am&mdash;I&mdash;I was just going to dress&mdash;&rdquo; cried I; I meant to
      add, and ought to have added, to &ldquo;wait upon the queen,&rdquo; but I was so
      unused to such a plea, that it sounded as a liberty to my mind's voice,
      and I could not get it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She desired she might be no impediment to me,&mdash;and we parted I was
      forced to let her go and to run into my own room, and fly&mdash;to my
      toilette Not quite the sort of flight I have been used to making. However,
      all is so new here that it makes but a part in the general change of
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady who had met me first was her daughter, Lady Frances Howard; and
      the gentleman, her second husband, Sir George Howard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I afterwards saw her ladyship in the queen's dressing-room, where her
      majesty sent for her as soon as she was dressed, and very graciously kept
      me some time, addressing me frequently while I stayed, in the conversation
      that took place, as if with a sweet view to point out to this first lady
      of her bedchamber I have yet seen, the favourable light in which she
      considers me.

    <h2>
      MAJOR PRICE AND COLONEL POLIER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Duke de Saxe-Gotha, first cousin to the king, came to Windsor to-day,
      to spend some time. Major Price, who had the honours to do to his chief
      attendant, Baron &mdash;&mdash;, missed us therefore at coffee; but at tea
      we had them both, and my dear Mrs. Delany, as well as the jovial gourmand
      colonel, with whom I became prodigiously well acquainted, by making him
      'teach me a few German phrases, which he always contrives, let me ask what
      question I may, to turn into some expression relating to eating and
      drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all were gone, except the Duke de Saxe-Gotha's baron and Major Price,
      I had a very long conversation with the major, while Mrs. Schwellenberg
      was entertaining the baron in German. I find, my dearest Susan, he has
      seen you often at Lady Clarges's; Sir Thomas<a href="#linknote-204"
       name="linknoteref-204" id="linknoteref-204">[204]</a> was his first
      cousin. He knows my dearest Mrs. Locke, also, by another cousin, Lady
      Templetown; and he knows me my own self by my cousins of Worcester. These
      mutual acquaintances have brought us into almost an intimacy at once, and
      I was quite glad of this opportunity of a little easy and natural
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, July 23</i>&mdash;Charles Wesley played the organ; and after
      the service was over he performed six or seven pieces by the king's order.
      They were all of Handel, and so well suited to the organ, and so well
      performed on a remarkably good instrument, that it was a great regale to
      me to hear them. The pleasure I received from the performance led me into
      being too late for the queen. I found I had already been enquired for to
      attend at the queen's toilette.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came back the tea-party were all assembled in the eating-parlour.
      Colonel Polier was in the highest spirits: the king had just bestowed some
      appointment upon him in Hanover. He was as happy as if just casting his
      eyes upon pine-apple, melon, and grapes. I made Mrs. Schwellenberg teach
      me how to wish him joy in German: which is the only phrase I have yet got
      that has no reference to eating or drinking.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY'S DAILY ROUTINE AT WINDSOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, July 24</i>&mdash;Having now journalized for one complete week,
      let me endeavour to give you, more connectedly, a concise abstract of the
      general method of passing the day, that then I may only write what varies,
      and occurs occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rise at six o'clock, dress in a morning gown and cap, and wait my first
      summons, which is at all times from seven to near eight, but commonly in
      the exact half hour between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen never sends for me till her hair is dressed. This, in a morning,
      is always done by her wardrobe-woman, Mrs. Thielky, a German, but who
      speaks English perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg, since the first week, has never come down in a morning
      at all. The queen's dress is finished by Mrs. Thielky and myself. No maid
      ever enters the room while the queen is in it. Mrs. Thielky hands the
      things to me, and I put them on. 'Tis fortunate for me I have not the
      handing them! I should never know which to take first, embarrassed as I
      am, and should run a prodigious risk of giving the gown before the hoop,
      and the fan before the neckkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eight o'clock, or a little after, for she is extremely expeditious, she
      is dressed. She then goes out to join the king, and be joined by the
      princesses, and they all proceed to the king's chapel in the Castle, to
      prayers, attended by the governesses of the princesses, and the king's
      equerry. Various others at times attend, but only these indispensably.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then return to my own room to breakfast. I make this meal the most
      pleasant part of the day; I have a book for my companion, and I allow
      myself an hour for it. At nine O'clock I send off my breakfast things, and
      relinquish my book, to make a serious and steady examination of everything
      I have upon my hands in the way of business&mdash;in which preparations
      for dress are always included, not for the present day alone, but for the
      Court-days, which require a particular dress; for the next arriving
      birthday of any of the royal family, every one of which requires new
      apparel; for Kew, where the dress is plainest; and for going on here,
      where the dress very pleasant to me, requiring no shew nor finery, but
      merely to be neat, not inelegant, and moderately fashionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      That over, I have my time at my own disposal till a quarter before twelve,
      except on Wednesdays and Saturdays, when I have it only to a quarter
      before eleven. My rummages and business sometimes occupy me
      uninterruptedly to those hours. When they do not, I give till ten to
      necessary letters of duty, ceremony, or long arrears;&mdash;and now, from
      ten to the times I have mentioned, I devote to walking. These times
      mentioned call me to the irksome and quick-returning labours of the
      toilette. The hour advanced on the Wednesdays and Saturdays is for curling
      and craping the hair, which it now requires twice a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter before one is the usual time for the queen to begin dressing for
      the day. Mrs. Schwellenberg then constantly attends; so do I; Mrs.
      Thielky, of course, at all times. We help her off with her gown, and on
      with her powdering things, and then the hair-dresser is admitted. She
      generally reads the newspaper during that operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she observes that I have run to her but half dressed, she constantly
      gives me leave to return and finish&mdash;as soon as she is seated. If she
      is grave, and reads steadily on, she dismisses me, whether I am dressed or
      not; but at all times she never forgets to send me away while she is
      powdering, with a consideration not to spoil my clothes, that one would
      not expect belonged to her high station. Neither does she ever detain me
      without making a point of reading here and there some little paragraph
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I return, I finish, if anything is undone, my dress, and then take
      Baretti's &ldquo;Dialogues,&rdquo; my dearest Fredy's &ldquo;Tablet of Memory,&rdquo; or some such
      disjointed matter, for the few minutes that elapse ere I am again
      summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find her then always removed to her state dressing-room. If any room in
      this private mansion can have the epithet of state. There, in a very short
      time, her dress is finished. She then says she won't detain me, and I hear
      and see no more of her till bed-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is commonly three o'clock when I am thus set at large. And I have then
      two hours quite at my disposal: but, in the natural course of things, not
      a moment after! These dear and quiet two hours, my only quite sure and
      undisturbed time in the whole day, after breakfast is over, I shall
      henceforth devote to thus talking with my beloved Susan, my Fredy, and my
      other sisters, my dear father, or Miss Cambridge; with my brothers,
      cousins, Mrs. Ord, and other friends, in such terms as these two hours
      will occasionally allow me. Henceforward, I say; for hitherto dejection of
      spirits, with uncertainty how long my time might last, have made me waste
      moment after moment as sadly as unprofitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five, we have dinner. Mrs. Schwellenberg and I meet in the eating-room.
      We are commonly tete-a-tete: when there is anybody added, it is from her
      invitation only. Whatever right my place might afford me of also inviting
      my friends to the table I have now totally lost, by want of courage and
      spirits to claim it originally.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have dined, we go upstairs to her apartment, which is directly
      over mine. Here we have coffee till the &ldquo;terracing&rdquo; is over: this is at
      about eight o'clock. Our tete-a-tete then finishes, and we come down again
      to the eating-room. There the equerry, whoever he is, comes to tea
      constantly, and with him any gentleman that the king or queen may have
      invited for the evening; and when tea is over, he conducts them, and goes
      himself, to the concert-room. This is commonly about nine o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time, if Mrs. Schwellenberg is alone, I never quit her for a
      minute, till I come to my little supper at near eleven. Between eleven and
      twelve my last summons usually takes place, earlier and later
      occasionally. Twenty minutes is the customary time then spent with the
      queen: half an hour, I believe, is seldom exceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then come back, and after doing whatever I can to forward <i>my</i>
      dress for the next morning, I go to bed-and to sleep, too, believe me: the
      early rising, and a long day's attention to new affairs and occupations,
      cause a fatigue so bodily, that nothing mental stands against it, and to
      sleep I fall the moment I have put out my candle and laid down my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the day to your F. B. in her new situation at Windsor; such, I
      mean, is its usual destination, and its intended course. I make it take
      now and then another channel, but never stray far enough not to return to
      the original stream after a little meandering about and about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think now you will be able to see and to follow me pretty closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to those summonses I speak of, I will now explain myself. My
      summons, upon all regular occasions&mdash;that is, morning, noon, and
      night toilets&mdash;is neither more nor less than a bell. Upon extra
      occasions a page is commonly sent. At first, I felt inexpressibly
      discomfited by this mode of call. A bell!&mdash;it seemed so mortifying a
      mark of servitude, I always felt myself blush, though alone, with
      conscious shame at my own strange degradation. But I have philosophized
      myself now into some reconcilement with this manner of summons, by
      reflecting that to have some person always sent would be often very
      inconvenient, and that this method is certainly less an interruption to
      any occupation I may be employed in, than the entrance of messengers so
      many times in the day. It is, besides, less liable to mistakes. So I have
      made up my mind to it as well as I can; and now I only feel that proud
      blush when somebody is by to revive my original dislike of it.

    <h2>
      THE PRINCESS ROYAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday, July 25.</i>&mdash;I now begin my second week, with a scene a
      little, not much, different. We were now to go to Kew, there to remain
      till Friday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had this morning, early, for the first time, a little visit from one of
      the princesses. I was preparing for my journey, when a little rap at my
      room-door made me call out &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and who should enter but the
      princess royal!
    </p>
    <p>
      I apologised for my familiar admittance, by my little expectation of such
      an hon<i>our</i>. She told me she had brought the queen's snuff-box, to be
      filled with some snuff which I had been directed to prepare. It is a very
      fine-scented and mild snuff, but requires being moistened from time to
      time, to revive its smell. The princess, with a very sweet smile, insisted
      upon holding the box while I filled it; and told me she had seen Mrs.
      Delany at the chapel, and that she was very well; and then she talked on
      about her, with a visible pleasure in having a subject so interesting to
      me to open upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the little commission was executed, she took her leave with an
      elegant civility of manner as if parting with another king's daughter. I
      am quite charmed with the princess royal unaffected condescension and
      native dignity are so happily blended in her whole deportment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had left me but a short time before she again returned. &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo;
       cried she, smiling with a look of congratulation, &ldquo;Mamma says the snuff is
      extremely well mixed; and she has sent another box to be filled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no more ready. She begged me not to mind, and not to hurry myself,
      for she would wait till it was done.

    <h2>
      THE COURT AT KEW: A THREE YEAR OLD PRINCESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg, Miss Planta, and myself travelled to Kew together. I
      have two rooms there; both small, and up two pair of stairs; but tidy and
      comfortable enough. Indeed all the apartments but the king's and queen's,
      and one of Mrs. Schwellenberg's, are small, dark, and old-fashioned. There
      are staircases in every passage, and passages to every closet. I lost
      myself continually, only in passing from my own room to the queen's. Just
      as I got upstairs, shown the way first by Miss Planta, I heard the king's
      voice. I slipped into my room; but he saw me, and following, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is Miss Burney taking possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he walked round the room, as if to see if it were comfortable for
      me, and smiling very good-humouredly, walked out again. A surveyor was
      with him,&mdash;I believe he is giving orders for some alterations and
      additions....
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went to the queen before dinner, the little Princess Amelia was
      with her; and, though shy of me at first, we afterwards made a very
      pleasant acquaintance. She is a most lovely little thing, just three years
      old, and full of sense, spirit, and playful prettiness: yet decorous and
      dignified when called upon to appear en princesse to any strangers, as if
      conscious of her high rank, and of the importance of condescendingly
      sustaining it. 'Tis amazing what education can do, in the earliest years,
      to those of quick understandings.<a href="#linknote-205"
       name="linknoteref-205" id="linknoteref-205">[205]</a> This little
      princess, thus in infancy, by practice and example, taught her own
      consequence, conducts herself, upon all proper occasions, with an air of
      dignity that is quite astonishing, though her natural character seems all
      sport and humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we became a little acquainted, the queen desired me to take her by
      the hand, and carry her downstairs to the king, who was waiting for her in
      the garden. She trusted herself to me with a grave and examining look, and
      shewed me, for I knew it not, the way. The king, who dotes upon her,
      seemed good-humouredly pleased to see me bring her. He took her little
      hand and led her away.

    <h2>
      A DRAWING-ROOM AT ST. JAMES'S.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday, July 27</i>&mdash;This being a Court-day, we went to town.
      The queen dresses her head at Kew, and puts on her Drawing-room apparel at
      St. James's. Her new attendant dresses all at Kew, except tippet and long
      ruffles, which she carries in paper, to save from dusty roads. I forgot to
      tell you, I believe, that at St. James's I can never appear, even though I
      have nothing to do with the Drawing-room, except in a sacque: 'tis the
      etiquette of my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg, Miss Planta, and myself went about an hour before the
      king and queen. Mrs. Schwellenberg went to the queen's dressing-room to
      give orders about the dress, Miss Planta went to the princesses' room for
      the same purpose, and I was shewn to mine for no purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine are two small rooms, newly and handsomely furnished, one of which has
      a view of the park, over the stable-yard, and the other only of the
      passage to the park from St. James's-street. I had now the great
      satisfaction to find that there was a private staircase, from that same
      passage, that leads straight up to my apartments, and also that I may
      appoint any friend to meet me in them on the court-days. I hope never to
      be there again without making use of this privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now neither companion nor book, I sent John, who came with me to
      town, to borrow some writing implements of one of the pages, and I
      employed myself in answering some letters, till the queen arrived, and I
      was summoned, by Mrs. Leverick, the town wardrobe woman, to the
      dressing-room. There the queen put on her court dress, and as soon as she
      was attired sent for the princesses royal and Augusta, who came to attend
      her to the Drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nicolay, the page in waiting, then came to beg a little audience for
      the Duchess of Aancaster.... The queen went to her in the ante-room&mdash;-The
      moment I was left with the princesses, they both came up to me, and began
      conversing in the most easy, unaffected, cheerful, and obliging manner
      that can be conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the queen returned, the bell was rung for the bedchamber woman; the
      etiquette of court-days requiring that one of them should finish her
      dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened now to be my acquaintance, Mrs. Fielding. She only tied on the
      necklace, and handed the fan and gloves. The queen then leaves the
      dressing-room, her train being carried by the bedchamber woman. The
      princesses follow. She goes to the ante-room, where she sends for the lady
      of the bedchamber in waiting, who then becomes the first train-bearer, and
      they all proceed to the Drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to Kew to dinner, very late.

    <h2>
      ABSENCE OF STATE AT KEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, July 28.</i>&mdash;The Kew life, you will perceive, is
      different from the Windsor. As there are no early prayers, the queen rises
      later; and as there is no form or ceremony here of any sort, her dress is
      plain, and the hour for the second toilette extremely uncertain. The royal
      family are here always in so very retired a way, that they live as the
      simplest country gentlefolks. The king has not even an equerry with him,
      nor the queen any lady to attend her when she goes her airings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta belongs here to our table; so does anybody that comes, as
      there is no other kept. There is no excuse for parting after dinner, and
      therefore I live unremittingly with Mrs. Schwellenberg after the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a still greater difficulty to see company here than at Windsor, for
      as my apartments are upstairs, there is a greater danger of encountering
      some of the royal family; and I find all the household are more delicate
      in inviting or admitting any friends here than elsewhere, on account of
      the very easy and unreserved way in which the family live, running about
      from one end of the house to the other, without precaution or care.

      <i>Windsor, July 28.</i>&mdash;To-day I made my first evening visit, and
      for the first time failed Mrs. Schwellenberg's tea-table entirely. You
      will be surprised to hear for whom I took this effort&mdash;Lady
      Effingham! But I found from Mrs. Delany she had been a little hurt by the
      passage-scene, and seemed to think I meant to avoid her future visits and
      civilities. Mrs. Delany, therefore, advised me to go to Stoke, her
      country-seat, by way of apologizing, and to request the queen's
      permission, Promising to carry me herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never hesitate where she counsels. I thought it, too, a good opportunity
      of trying my length of liberty, as Lady Effingham is one of the ladies of
      the bedchamber, and is frequently at the Lodge as a private visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inexpressibly awkward to me to ask leave to go out, and awkwardly
      enough I believe I did it, only saying that if her majesty had no
      objection, Mrs. Delany would carry me in the evening to Stoke. She smiled
      immediate approbation, and nothing more passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had then to tell my intention to Mrs. Schwellenberg who was, I believe,
      a little surprised. Fortunately, Major Price came upstairs to coffee. A
      little surprised, too, I am sure, was Major Price, when I made off for the
      whole evening. Everybody had taken it for granted I must necessarily
      pursue the footsteps of Mrs. Haggerdorn, and never stir out. But, thank
      God, I am not in the same situation; she had no connections&mdash;I have
      such as no one, I believe, ever had before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was rainy; but, my leave asked and obtained, my kind Mrs.
      Delany would not defer the excursion. Stoke is about three miles off.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were received in the civilest manner possible by Lady Effingham, and
      Sir George Howard and Lady Frances. There were also several of their
      relations with them. Lady Effingham seems a mighty good-humoured, friendly
      woman. Sir George is pompous, yet he, too, is as good-humoured in his
      manners as his Lady.

    <h2>
      CASUAL CALLERS TO BE KEPT OFF: A NEW ARRIVAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>July 31.</i>&mdash;I had a very pleasant visit from Mrs. Hastings<a
      href="#linknote-206" name="linknoteref-206" id="linknoteref-206">[206]</a>
      this morning, whose gay good-humour is very enlivening: but she detained
      me from my dress, and I was not ready for the queen; and I have now
      adopted the measure of stationing John in the gallery while I am at that
      noble occupation, and making him keep off all callers, by telling them I
      am dressing for the queen. I have no other way; and being too late, or
      even the fear of being too late, makes me nervous and ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every little failure of this sort, though always from causes unknown to
      her majesty, she has borne without even a look of surprise or of gravity;
      though she never waits an instant, for if Mrs. Schwellenberg is not with
      her, she employs Mrs. Thielky, or goes on with her dress or her undress
      without either.
    </p>
    <p>
      This graciousness, however, makes me but the more earnest to grow
      punctual; especially as I am now always employed, when present and in
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went in the afternoon to Mrs. de Luc. When I returned here, to the
      conclusion of the tea-drinking, I found a new gentleman, dressed in the
      king's Windsor uniform&mdash;which is blue and gold, turned up with red,
      and worn by all the men who belong to his majesty, and come into his
      presence at Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Price immediately presented us to each other. It was General Bude:
      what his post may be I have not yet learned, but he is continually, I am
      told, at Windsor, and always resides in this Lodge, and eats with the
      equerries.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not quite know what to say of General Bude; except that his person is
      tall and showy, and his manners and appearance are fashionable. But he has
      a sneer in his smile that looks sarcastic, and a distance in his manner
      that seems haughty.

    <h2>
      THE ROYAL PRINCESSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday, 2.</i>&mdash;This morning, for the first time, I made a
      little sort of acquaintance with the two younger princesses. I was coming
      from the queen's room, very early, when I met the Princess Mary, just
      arrived from the lower Lodge: she was capering upstairs to her elder
      sisters, but instantly stopped at sight of me, and then coming up to me,
      inquired how I did, with all the elegant composure of a woman of maturest
      age. Amazingly well are all these children brought up. The readiness and
      the grace of their civilities, even in the midst of their happiest
      wildnesses and freedom, are at once a surprise and a charm to all who see
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, when she goes to early prayers, often leaves me the charge of
      her little favourite dog, Badine. To-day, after her return, she sent her
      page for him; and presently after, I had a rap again at the door, and the
      little Princess Sophia entered. &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried she, curtseying and
      colouring, &ldquo;Mamma has sent me for the little dog's basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I begged her permission to carry it to the queen's room but she would not
      suffer me, and insisted upon taking it herself, with a mingled modesty and
      good breeding extremely striking in one so young.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half an hour after she returned again, accompanying the princess
      royal. The queen had given me a new collection of German books, just sent
      over, to cut open for her; and she employed the princess royal to label
      them. She came most smilingly to the occupation, and said she would write
      down their names, &ldquo;if I pleased,&rdquo; in my room. You may believe I was not
      much displeased. I gave her a pencil, and she seized a piece of
      whity-brown paper, inquiring &ldquo;if she might have it?&rdquo;&mdash;I would fain
      have got her better, but she began writing immediately, stooping to the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now in a momentary doubt whether or not it would be proper, or too
      great a liberty, to ask her royal highness to be seated; but, after a
      moment's hesitation, I thought it best to place her a chair, and say
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did; and she turned about to me with a most graceful curtsey, and
      immediately accepted it, with a most condescending apology for my trouble.
      I then, thus encouraged, put another chair for the little Princess Sophia,
      who took it as sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray sit down too,&rdquo; cried the princess royal: &ldquo;I beg you will, Miss
      Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I resisted a little while; but she would not hear me, insisting, with the
      most obliging earnestness, upon carrying her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      She writes German with as much facility as I do English and therefore, the
      whole time she was taking down the titles of the books, she kept up a
      conversation, Mrs. Delany her well and kindly chosen subject. When she had
      done her task, she quitted me with the same sweetness, and the Princess
      Mary ran in for her little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess royal, not long after, again returned:&mdash;&ldquo;There is no end
      to me, you will think, this morning,&rdquo; cried she, on entering; and then
      desired to have all the books I had cut open; nor would she suffer me to
      carry one for her, though they were incommodious, from their quantity, for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such has been the singular condescension of the queen, that every little
      commission with which she has yet intrusted me she has contrived to render
      highly honourable, by giving the princesses some share in them.

    <h2>
      ALARMING NEWS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening I had no little difficulty how to manage to go to Mrs.
      Delany,&mdash;for I have here to mention the worst thing that has happened
      to me at Windsor,&mdash;the desertion of Major Price from the coffee. The
      arrival of General Bude, who belongs to the equerries' table, has
      occasioned his staying to do the honours to him till terrace time. At tea,
      they belong to Mrs. Schwellenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has not only lost me some of his society, the most pleasant I had had
      in the Lodge, but has trebled my trouble to steal away. While I left him
      behind, the absconding from a beau was apology all-sufficient for running
      away from a belle; but now I am doubly wanted to stay, and too-doubly
      earnest to go!...
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into my own room for my cloak, and, as usual, found Madame de la
      Fite just waiting for me. She was all emotion,&mdash;she seized my hand,&mdash;&ldquo;Have
      you heard?&mdash;O mon Dieu!&mdash;O le bon Roi! O Miss Burney!&mdash;what
      an horrreur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was very much startled, but soon ceased to wonder at her perturbation;&mdash;she
      had been in the room with the Princess Elizabeth, and there heard, from
      Miss Goldsworthy, that an attempt had just been made upon the life of the
      king!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was almost petrified with horror at the intelligence. If this king is
      not safe&mdash;good, pious, beneficent as he is&mdash;if his life is in
      danger, from his own subjects, what is to guard the throne? and which way
      is a monarch to be secure?
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Fite had heard of the attempt only, not the particulars; but
      I was afterwards informed of them in the most interesting manner,&mdash;namely,
      how they were related to the queen. And as the newspapers will have told
      you all else, I shall only and briefly tell that.
    </p>
    <p>
      No information arrived here of the matter before his majesty's return, at
      the usual hour in the afternoon, from the levee. The Spanish minister had
      hurried off instantly to Windsor, and was in waiting, at Lady Charlotte
      Finch's, to be ready to assure her majesty of the king's safety, in case
      any report anticipated his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen had the two eldest princesses, the Duchess of Ancaster, and Lady
      Charlotte Bertie with her when the king came in. He hastened up to her,
      with a countenance of striking vivacity, and said, &ldquo;Here I am!&mdash;safe
      and well,&mdash;as you see!&mdash;but I have very narrowly escaped being
      stabbed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His own conscious safety, and the pleasure he felt in thus personally
      shewing it to the queen, made him not aware of the effect of so abrupt a
      communication. The queen was seized with a consternation that at first
      almost stupefied her, and after a most painful silence, the first words
      she could articulate were, in looking round at the duchess and Lady
      Charlotte, who had both burst into tears,&mdash;&ldquo;I envy you!&mdash;I can't
      cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two princesses were for a little while in the same state but the tears
      of the duchess proved infectious, and they then' wept even with violence.

    <h2>
      THE ATTEMPT AGAINST THE KING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king, with the gayest good-humour, did his utmost to comfort them; and
      then gave a relation of the affair, with a calmness and unconcern that,
      had any one but himself been his hero, would have been regarded as totally
      unfeeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have heard it wrong; I will concisely tell it right. His carriage
      had just stopped at the garden-door at St. James's, and he had just
      alighted from it, when a decently-dressed woman, who had been waiting for
      him some time, approached him, with a petition. It was rolled up, and had
      the usual superscription&mdash;&ldquo;For the king's most excellent majesty.&rdquo;
       She presented it with her right hand; and at the same moment that the king
      bent forward to take it, she drew from it, with her left hand, a knife,
      with which she aimed straight at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortunate awkwardness of taking the instrument with the left hand made
      her design perceived before it could be executed;&mdash;the king started
      back, scarce believing the testimony of his own eyes; and the woman made a
      second thrust, which just touched his waistcoat before he had time to
      prevent her;&mdash;and at that moment one of the attendants, seeing her
      horrible intent, wrenched the knife from her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she cut my waistcoat?&rdquo; cried he, in telling it,&mdash;&ldquo;Look! for I
      have had no time to examine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thank heaven, however, the poor wretch had not gone quite so far. &ldquo;Though
      nothing,&rdquo; added the king, in giving his relation, &ldquo;could have been sooner
      done, for there was nothing for her to go through but a thin linen, and
      fat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the guards and his own people now surrounded the king, the assassin
      was seized by the populace, who were tearing her away, no doubt to fall
      the instant sacrifice of her murtherous purpose, when the king, the only
      calm and moderate person then present, called aloud to the mob, &ldquo;The poor
      creature is mad!&mdash;Do not hurt her! She has not hurt me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then came forward, and showed himself to all the people, declaring he
      was perfectly safe and unhurt; and then gave positive orders that the
      woman should be taken care of, and went into the palace, and had his
      levee.<a href="#linknote-207" name="linknoteref-207" id="linknoteref-207">[207]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something in the whole of his behaviour upon this occasion that
      strikes me as proof indisputable of a true and noble courage: for in a
      moment so extraordinary&mdash;an attack, in this country, unheard of
      before&mdash;to settle so instantly that it was the effect of insanity, to
      feel no apprehension of private plot or latent conspiracy&mdash;to stay
      out, fearlessly, among his people, and so benevolently to see himself to
      the safety of one who had raised her arm against his life,&mdash;these
      little traits, all impulsive, and therefore to be trusted, have given me
      an impression of respect and reverence that I can never forget, and never
      think of but with fresh admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that love of prerogative, so falsely assigned, were true, what an
      opportunity was here offered to exert it! Had he instantly taken refuge in
      his palace, ordered out all his guards, stopped every avenue to St.
      James's, and issued his commands that every individual present at this
      scene should be secured and examined,&mdash;who would have dared murmur,
      or even blame such measures? The insanity of the woman has now fully been
      proved; but that noble confidence which gave that instant excuse for her
      was then all his own.

    <h2>
      AGITATION OF THE QUEEN AND PRINCESSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nor did he rest here; notwithstanding the excess of terror for his safety,
      and doubt of further mischief, with which all his family and all his
      household were seized, he still maintained the most cheerful composure,
      and insisted upon walking on the terrace, with no other attendant than his
      single equerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor queen went with him, pale and silent,&mdash;the princesses
      followed, scarce yet commanding their tears. In the evening, just as
      usual, the king had his concert: but it was an evening of grief and horror
      to his family: nothing was listened to, scarce a word was spoken; the
      princesses wept continually; the queen, still more deeply struck, could
      only, from time to time, hold out her hand to the king, and say, &ldquo;I have
      you yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The affection for the king felt by all his household has been at once
      pleasant and affecting to me to observe: there has not been a dry eye in
      either of the Lodges, on the recital of his danger, and not a face but his
      own that has not worn marks of care ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put off my visit to my dear Mrs. Delany; I was too much horror-struck to
      see her immediately; and when, at night, I went to her, I determined to
      spare her the shock of this event till the next day.... General Bude and
      Major Price were with Mrs. Schwellenberg at my return; and not a word was
      uttered by either of them concerning the day's terrific alarm. There
      seemed nothing but general consternation and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went to the queen at night she scarce once opened her lips. Indeed
      I could not look at her without feeling the tears ready to start into my
      eyes. But I was very glad to hear again the voice of the king, though only
      from the next apartment, and calling to one of his dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>August 3</i>&mdash;The poor queen looked so ill that it was easy to see
      how miserable had been her night. It is unfortunately the unalterable
      opinion of Mrs. Schwellenberg that some latent conspiracy belongs to this
      attempt, and therefore that it will never rest here. This dreadful
      suggestion preys upon the mind of the queen, though she struggles to
      conquer or conceal it. I longed passionately this morning, when alone with
      her, to speak upon the matter, and combat the opinion; but as she still
      said nothing, it was not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was dressed for the chapel, she desired me to keep little Badine;
      but he ran out after her: I ran too, and in the gallery, leading from the
      queen's room to mine, all the princesses, and their governesses, were
      waiting for the queen. They all looked very ill, the princess royal
      particularly.&mdash;O well indeed might they tremble! for a father more
      tender, more kind, more amiable, I believe has scarcely ever had daughters
      to bless....
    </p>
    <p>
      I then passed on to my own room, which terminates this gallery. But I have
      since heard it is contrary to rule to pass even the door of an apartment
      in which any of the royal family happen to be, if it is open. However,
      these little formalities are all dispensed with to the ignorant&mdash;and
      as I learn better I shall observe them more. I am now obliged to feel and
      find my way as I can, having no friend, adviser, nor informer in the whole
      house. Accident only gives me any instruction, and that generally arrives
      too late to save all error. My whole dependence is upon the character of
      the queen; her good sense and strong reason will always prevent the
      unnecessary offence of ranking mistakes from inexperience, with disrespect
      or inattention. I have never, therefore, a moment's uneasiness upon these
      points. Though there is a lady who from time to time represents them as
      evils the most heinous.<a href="#linknote-208" name="linknoteref-208"
       id="linknoteref-208">[208]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I had afterwards a letter from my poor Mrs. Delany, written with her own
      hand, and with a pencil, as she is now too indistinct of sight to see even
      a word. She writes therefore only by memory, and, if with pen and ink,
      cannot find her place again when she leaves it, to dip the pen in the
      inkstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had escaped the news at the chapel, but had been told it afterwards by
      Lady Spencer, lest it should reach her ears in any worse manner. You may
      imagine how greatly it shocked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran to answer her note in person, determining, upon such an occasion, to
      risk appearing before the queen a second time in my morning dress, rather
      than not satisfy my dear Mrs. Delany by word of mouth. I gave her all the
      comfort in my power, and raised her agitated spirits by dwelling upon the
      escape, and slightly passing by the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen was so late before her second summons that I was still in time.
      I found her with her eyes almost swollen out of her head, but more
      cheerful and easy, and evidently relieved by the vent forced, at length,
      to her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now first spoke upon the subject to me; inquiring how Mrs. Delany had
      borne the hearing it. I told her of the letter sent me in the morning, and
      half proposed shewing it, as it expressed her feelings beyond the power of
      any other words. She bowed her desire to see it, and I ran and brought it.
      She read it aloud, Mrs. Schwellenberg being present, and was pleased and
      soothed by it.

      A little incident happened afterwards that gave me great satisfaction in
      perspective. While I was drinking coffee with Mrs. Schwellenberg, a
      message was brought to me, that Mrs. and Miss Heberden<a
      href="#linknote-209" name="linknoteref-209" id="linknoteref-209">[209]</a>
      desired their compliments, and would come to drink tea with me if I was
      disengaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      To drink tea with me! The words made me colour. I hesitated,&mdash;I knew
      not if I might accept such an offer. With regard to themselves, I had
      little or no interest in it, as they were strangers to me, but with regard
      to such an opening to future potentiality,&mdash;there, indeed, the
      message acquired consequence. After keeping the man some minutes, I was so
      much at a loss, still, to know what step I had power to take, that I was
      induced to apply to Mrs. Schwellenberg, asking her what I must do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you please!&rdquo; was her answer; and I waited nothing more explicit, but
      instantly sent back my compliments, and that I should be very glad of
      their company.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a most happy event to me: it first let me know the possibility of
      receiving a friend in my own room to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left me before the tea-party assembled in our common room. It was
      very much crowded, everybody being anxious to hear news of the queen. When
      they were all gone but Mrs. Delany, Mrs. Schwellenberg made us both very
      happy by a private communication that the Prince of Wales was actually
      then in the Lodge, whither he rode post haste, on the first news of the
      alarm given to the queen.

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN CONTINUES ANXIOUS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, Aug. 4</i>&mdash;This was an extremely arduous morning to the
      poor queen. The king again went to town; and her anxiety in his absence,
      and fear how it might end, oppressed her most painfully. She could not
      take her usual airing. She shut herself up with the Princess Augusta; but,
      to avoid any rumours of her uneasiness, the carriage and usual horsemen
      were all at the door at the customary time; and the princess royal,
      attended by the Duchess of Ancaster, went out, and passed, driving quick
      through the town, for the queen herself, to most of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her toilette, before dinner, Lady Effingham was admitted. The queen had
      her newspapers as usual, and she read aloud, while her hair was dressing,
      several interesting articles concerning the attack, the noble humanity of
      the king, his presence of mind, and the blessing to the whole nation
      arising from his preservation. The spirit of loyalty, warmth, and zeal
      with which all the newspapers are just now filled seemed extremely
      gratifying to her; she dwelt upon several of the strongest expressions
      with marked approbation, exclaiming from time to time, as she read
      particular praises of his majesty's worth and importance, &ldquo;That is true!&mdash;That
      is true, indeed!&rdquo; But suddenly, afterwards, coming upon a paragraph
      beginning with the words of the coronation anthem, &ldquo;Long live the king!
      May the king live for ever!&rdquo; her tears flowed so fast that they blinded
      her, and to hear her read such words was so extremely affecting, that I
      was obliged to steal behind her chair to hide myself; while Lady Effingham
      took out her handkerchief, and cried in good earnest. I believe her to be
      warmly and gratefully attached both to the king and queen and she has
      received from the queen very uncommon assistance, I am informed, in some
      very distressful situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, however, read on; dispersing her tears as she could, and always
      smiling through them when the praise, not the danger, drew them forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more gracious than her manner to me the whole time&mdash;she
      did not, as usual, dismiss me, either for her hair-dressing, or for Lady
      Effingham; she was sure I must be interested in what was going forward,
      and she looked at us alternately, for our comments, as she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rejoiced she had not set me to read these papers. I expected, for the
      first week, every summons would have ended in a command to read to her.
      But it never happened, and I was saved an exertion for which I am sure I
      should have had no voice.

    <h2>
      SNUFF PREPARER-IN&mdash;CHIEF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, Aug. 6</i>&mdash;This morning, before church, Miss Planta was
      sent to me by the queen, for some snuff, to be mixed as before: when I had
      prepared it, I carried it, as directed, to her majesty's dressing-room. I
      turned round the lock, for that, not rapping at the door, is the mode of
      begging admission; and she called out to me to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found her reading, aloud, some religious book, but I could not discover
      what, to the three eldest princesses. Miss Planta was in waiting. She
      continued after my entrance, only motioning to me that the snuff might be
      put into a box on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not execute my task very expeditiously: for I was glad of this
      opportunity of witnessing, the maternal piety with which she enforced, in
      voice and expression, every sentence that contained any lesson that might
      be useful to her royal daughters. She reads extremely well, with great
      force, clearness, and meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I had slowly finished my commission, the king entered. She then
      stopped, and rose; so instantly did the princesses. He had a letter in his
      hand open: he said something to the queen in German, and they left the
      room together but he turned round from the door, and first spoke to me,
      with a good-humoured laugh, saying, &ldquo;Miss Burney, I hear you cook snuff
      very well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cook snuff!&rdquo; repeated the Princess Augusta, laughing and coming up to me
      the moment they left the room. &ldquo;Pray, Miss Burney, let me have one pinch!&rdquo;
       The Princess Elizabeth ran up to me, also, exclaiming, &ldquo;Miss Burney, I
      hope you hate snuff? I hope you do, for I hate it of all things in the
      world!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A SUPPER MYSTERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After tea, one of Mrs. Schwellenberg's domestics called me out of the
      room. John waited to speak to me in the gallery. &ldquo;What time, ma'am,&rdquo; cried
      he, &ldquo;shall you have your Supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What supper?&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;I only eat fruit, as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have not you ordered supper, ma'am, for to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one cooking for you&mdash;a fowl and peas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's some great mistake; run down and tell them so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the company, and would have related the adventure, had I
      been in spirits; but voluntary speech escaped me not. Where I am not
      happy, or forced to it, it never does. Presently I was called out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am,&rdquo; cried John, &ldquo;the supper is ordered in your name. I saw the order&mdash;the
      clerk of the kitchen gave it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. I desired him to run down
      forthwith, and inquire by whose directions all this was done. He came
      back, and said, &ldquo;By Sir Francis Drake's.&rdquo; Sir Francis Drake is, I think,
      steward of the household. I then desired John to interfere no more, but
      let the matter be pursued in their own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the company was gone, all but a Miss Mawer, who is on a visit
      to Mrs. Schwellenberg, I told my tale. Mrs. Schwellenberg said the orders
      had been hers, that a hot supper belonged to my establishment, and that
      sometimes she might come and eat it with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now not a word to add. At ten o'clock both she and Miss Mawer
      accompanied me to my room. Miss Mawer is an old maid; tall, thin,
      sharp-featured, hurrying and disagreeable in her manner, but, I believe,
      good-natured and good-hearted, from all I have observed in her. The smell
      of the meat soon grew offensive to Mrs. Schwellenberg, who left me with
      Miss Mawer. As I never eat any myself at night, all I could devise to make
      the perfume tolerable was to consider it as an opportunity for a lesson in
      carving: so I went to work straightforward to mangle my unbidden guest,
      for the use and service of Miss Mawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, I was delighted and surprised by the entrance of Mrs. Delany,
      ushered to my room by Major Price. The concert being over, and the royal
      family retired to supper, she would not go away without seeing me. I
      thanked the major for bringing me so sweet a guest, but I almost fear he
      expected to be invited in with her. I am sure I could have had nothing but
      pleasure from his joining us; but I had made a rule, on my thus first
      setting up for myself, to invite no man whatsoever, young, old, married,
      single, acquaintance or stranger, till I knew precisely the nature of my
      own situation: for I had been warned by an excellent friend, Mrs. de Luc,
      on my first entrance into office that there was no drawing back in a place
      such as this; and that therefore I ought studiously to keep back, till I
      felt my way, and knew, experimentally, what I could do, and what I should
      wish to leave alone. This advice has been of singular use to me, in a
      thousand particulars, from the very first to the present day of my abode
      in this Lodge.

    <h2>
      LITTLE PRINCESS AMELIA'S BIRTHDAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, Aug. 7</i>&mdash;This has been the first cheerful day since the
      memorable and alarming attack of the 2nd of August. It was the birthday of
      the little Princess Amelia: and the fondness of the whole family for that
      lovely child, and her own infantine enjoyment of the honours paid her,
      have revived the spirits of the whole house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner of keeping the birth-days here is very simple. All the royal
      family are new-dressed; so&mdash;at least so they appear&mdash;are all
      their attendants. The dinners and desserts are unusually sumptuous; and
      some of the principal officers of state, and a few of the ladies of the
      Court, come to Windsor to make their compliments; and at night there is a
      finer concert, by an addition from town of the musicians belonging to the
      queen's band. If the weather is fine, all the family walk upon the
      Terrace, which is crowded with people of distinction, who take that mode
      of showing respect, to avoid the trouble and fatigue of attending at the
      following Drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another method, too, which is taken to express joy and attachment upon
      these occasions, is by going to the eight o'clock prayers at the royal
      chapel. The congregation all assemble, after the service, in the opening
      at the foot of the great stairs which the royal family descend from their
      gallery, and there those who have any pretensions to notice scarce ever
      fail to meet with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, this staircase Drawing-room, as it is named by Major Price, was
      very much crowded; and it was a sweet sight to me, from my windows, to see
      that the royal group respectfully followed by many people of distinction,
      who came on the occasion, and, at a still greater distance, encircled by
      humbler, but not less loyal congratulators, had their chief attention upon
      my dear, aged, venerable Mrs. Delany, who was brought in by the king and
      queen, to partake with them the birth-day breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, for the first time since my arrival, I went upon the
      Terrace, under the wing and protection of my dear Mrs. Delany, who was
      tempted to walk there herself, in order to pay her respects on the little
      princess's birth-day. She was carried in her chair to the foot of the
      steps. Mrs. Delany was desirous to save herself for the royal encounter:
      she therefore sat down on the first seat till the royal party appeared in
      sight: we then, of course, stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really a mighty pretty procession. The little princess, just turned
      of three years old, in a robe-coat covered with fine muslin, a dressed
      close cap, white gloves, and a fan, walked on alone and first, highly
      delighted in the parade, and turning from side to side to see everybody as
      she passed: for all the terracers stand up against the walls, to make a
      clear passage for the royal family, the moment they come in sight. Then
      followed the king and queen, no less delighted themselves with the joy of
      their little darling. The princess royal, leaning on Lady Elizabeth
      Waldegrave, followed at a little distance. This princess, the second
      female in the kingdom, shews, I think, more marked respect and humility
      towards the king and queen than any of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the Princess Augusta, holding by the Duchess of Ancaster; and next
      the Princess Elizabeth, holding by Lady Charlotte Bertie. Office here
      takes place of rank, which occasioned Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave, as lady
      of her bedchamber, to walk with the princess royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the Princess Mary with Miss Goldsworthy, and the Princess
      Sophia with Mademoiselle Monmoulin and Miss Planta then General Bude and
      the Duke of Montagu and, lastly, Major Price, who, as equerry, always
      brings up the rear, walks at a distance from the group, and keeps off all
      crowd from the royal family.
    </p>
    <p>
      On sight of Mrs. Delany, the king instantly stopped to speak to her. The
      queen, of course, and the little princess, and all the rest, stood still,
      in their ranks. They talked a good while with the sweet old lady; during
      which time the king once or twice addressed himself to me. I caught the
      queen's eye, and saw in it a little surprise, but by no means any
      displeasure, to see me of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little princess went up to Mrs. Delany, of whom she is very fond, and
      behaved like a little angel to her: she then, with a look of inquiry and
      recollection, slowly, of her own accord, came behind Mrs. Delany to look
      at me. &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said I, in a whisper, and stooping down, &ldquo;your royal
      highness does not remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What think you was her answer? An arch little smile, and a nearer
      approach, with her lips pouted out to kiss me. I could not resist so
      innocent an invitation, but the moment I had accepted it, I was half
      afraid it might seem, in so public a place, an improper liberty: however,
      there was no help for it. She then took my fan, and, having looked at it
      on both sides, gravely returned it me, saying, &ldquo;O! a brown fan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king and queen then bid her curtsey to Mrs. Delany which she did most
      gracefully, and they all moved on; each of the princesses speaking to Mrs.
      Delany as they passed, and condescending to curtsey to her companion.

    <h2>
      THE CIPHER BECOMES A NUMBER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany was too much fatigued to return to the Lodge to tea; but Mrs.
      Fielding and her three daughters, Lord Courtown, Mr. Fisher, the general,
      and the major, made up our set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg was very ill. She declined making tea, and put it into
      the hands of the general. I had always kept back from that office, as well
      as from presiding at the table, that I might keep the more quiet, and be
      permitted to sit silent; which, at first, was a repose quite necessary to
      my depressed state of spirits, and which, as they grew better, I found
      equally necessary to keep off the foul fiends of Jealousy and Rivalry in
      my colleague; who, apparently, never wishes to hear my voice but when we
      are tete-a-tete, and then never is in good-humour when it is at rest. I
      could not, however, see this feminine occupation in masculine hands, and
      not, for shame, propose taking it upon myself. The general readily
      relinquished it, and I was fain to come forth and do the honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Courtown sat himself next me, and talked with me the whole time, in
      well-bred and pleasant discourse. The Major waited upon me as assiduously
      as if he had been as much my equerry as the king's, and all went smooth,
      well, and naturally, except that the poor sick lady grew evidently less
      and less pleased with the arrangement of things, and less and less in
      humour with its arrangers: so obvious, indeed, was the displeasure that
      the cipher should become a number, that had my own mind been easy, I
      should have felt much vexed to observe what a curb was placed over me: for
      hitherto, except when she had been engaged herself, and only to Major
      Price and Mr. Fisher, that cipher had &ldquo;word spoke never one.&rdquo; 'Tis
      wonderful, my dearest Susan, what wretched tempers are to be met with&mdash;wretched
      in and to themselves&mdash;wretched to and for all that surround them.
      However, while only to be stupid and silent will do, we shall not be at
      variance. Were I happier, perhaps I might comply with more difficulty; so
      be not sorry, my Susan, nor you, my sweet Fredy, if, bye-and-bye, you
      should hear me complain. It will be a very good sign.

    <h2>
      DISPLAY OF LOYALTY AT LITTLE KEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Aug. 8.</i>&mdash;An exceedingly pretty scene was exhibited to-day to
      their majesties. We came, as usual on every alternate Tuesday, to Kew. The
      queen's Lodge is at the end of a long meadow, surrounded with houses,
      which is called Kew green; and this was quite filled with all the
      inhabitants of the place&mdash;the lame, old, blind, sick, and infants,
      who all assembled, dressed in their Sunday garb, to line the sides of the
      roads through which their majesties passed, attended by a band of
      musicians, arranged in the front, who began &ldquo;God save the King!&rdquo; the
      moment they came upon the green, and finished it with loud huzzas. This
      was a compliment at the expense of the better inhabitants, who paid the
      musicians themselves, and mixed in with the group, which indeed left not a
      soul, I am told, in any house in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This testimony of loyal satisfaction in the king's safe return, after the
      attempted assassination, affected the queen to tears: nor were they shed
      alone; for almost everybody's flowed that witnessed the scene. The queen,
      speaking of it afterwards, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! I shall always love little Kew for this!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MISS BERNAR, THE QUEEN WILL GIVE YOU A GOWN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the second toilette to-day, Mrs. Schwellenberg, who left the
      dressing-room before me, called out at the door, &ldquo;Miss Bernar, when you
      have done from the queen, come to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something rather more peremptory in the order than was quite
      pleasant to me, and I rather drily answered, &ldquo;Very well, Mrs.
      Schwellenberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen was even uncommonly sweet and gracious in her manner after this
      lady's departure, and kept me with her some time after she was dressed. I
      never go from her presence till I am dismissed; no one does, not even when
      they come in only with a hurried message,&mdash;except the pages, who
      enter merely as messengers, and Mrs. Schwellenberg, whose place and
      illness together have given her that privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general form of the dismission, which you may perhaps be curious to
      hear, is in these words, &ldquo;Now I will let you go,&rdquo; which the queen manages
      to speak with a grace that takes from them all air of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I must confess, there was something inexpressibly awkward to me,
      in waiting to be told to go, instead of watching an opportunity, as
      elsewhere, for taking leave before I thought myself de trop: but I have
      since found that this is, to me, a mark of honour; as it is the
      established custom to people of the first rank, the princesses themselves
      included, and only not used to the pages and the wardrobe-women, who are
      supposed only to enter for actual business, and therefore to retire when
      it is finished, without expectation of being detained to converse, or
      beyond absolute necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I give you all these little details of interior royalty, because they are
      curious, from opening a new scene of life, and can only be really known by
      interior residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went to Mrs. Schwellenberg, she said, &ldquo;You might know I had
      something to say to you, by my calling you before the queen.&rdquo; She then
      proceeded to a long prelude, which I could but ill comprehend, save that
      it conveyed much of obligation on my part, and favour on hers; and then
      ended with, &ldquo;I might tell you now, the queen is going to Oxford, and you
      might go with her; it is a secret&mdash;you might not tell it nobody. But
      I tell you once, I shall do for you what I can; you are to have a gown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared, and drew back, with a look so undisguised of wonder and
      displeasure at this extraordinary speech, that I saw it was understood,
      and she then thought it time, therefore, to name her authority, which with
      great emphasis, she did thus: &ldquo;The queen will give you a gown! The queen
      says you are not rich,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the manner of this quite intolerable to me, and I
      hastily interrupted her with saying, &ldquo;I have two new gowns by me, and
      therefore do not require another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a proposed present from her majesty was never so received before;
      but the grossness of the manner of the messenger swallowed up the
      graciousness of the design in the principal: and I had not even a wish to
      conceal how little it was to my taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest surprise sat upon her brow; she had imagined that a gown&mdash;that
      any present&mdash;would have been caught at with obsequious avidity,&mdash;but
      indeed she was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the wonder and displeasure now hers, I calmly added, &ldquo;The queen is
      very good, and I am very sensible of her majesty's graciousness; but there
      is not, in this instance, the least occasion for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bernar,&rdquo; cried she, quite angrily, &ldquo;I tell you once, when the queen
      will give you a gown, you must be humble, thankful, when you are Duchess
      of Ancaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then enumerated various ladies to whom her majesty had made the same
      present, many of them of the first distinction, and all, she said, great
      secrets. Still I only repeated again the same speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can bear to be checked and curbed in discourse, and would rather be
      subdued into silence&mdash;and even, if that proves a gratification that
      secures peace and gives pleasure, into apparent insensibility; but to
      receive a favour through the vehicle of insolent ostentation&mdash;no! no!
      To submit to ill humour rather than argue and dispute I think an exercise
      of patience, and I encourage myself all I can to practice it: but to
      accept even a shadow of an obligation upon such terms I should think mean
      and unworthy; and therefore I mean always, in a Court as I would
      elsewhere, to be open and fearless in declining such subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished her list of secret ladies, I told her I must beg to
      speak to the queen, and make my own acknowledgments for her gracious
      intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      This she positively forbid; and said it must only pass through her hands.
      &ldquo;When I give you the gown,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I will tell you when you may make
      your curtsey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was not vexed at this prohibition, not knowing what etiquette I might
      offend by breaking it; and the conversation concluded with nothing being
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      How little did the sweet queen imagine that this her first mark of favour
      should so be offered me as to raise in me my first spirit of resistance!
      How differently would she have executed her own commission herself! To
      avoid exciting jealousy was, I doubt not, her motive for employing
      another.

    <h2>
      A CROWDED DRAWING-ROOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Aug. 10.</i>&mdash;I journeyed to town, with Mrs. Schwellenberg and
      Miss Planta; and this morning I was employed for the first time on a
      message to the queen. I was in the ante-room, when Mr. Nicolay, her
      majesty's page at St. James's, came and told me the Duchess of Ancaster
      sent her humble duty to the queen, and begged an audience before the
      Drawing-room. I told the queen, who, when dressed, all but her necklace,
      received the duchess in the ante-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mention all these little ceremonies as they occur, that hereafter I may
      have no occasion, when they lead to other matters, to explain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bedchamber woman was rung for on the queen's return. So you see I am
      not the only one to answer a bell. It was Mrs. Fielding, who looked at me
      with an attention that will not leave her much in doubt as to my dress, at
      least, though she could not speak. I have told you, I believe, that no
      one, not even the princesses, ever speak in the presence of the king and
      queen, but to answer what is immediately said by themselves. There are,
      indeed, occasions in which this is set aside, from particular
      encouragement given at the moment; but it is not less a rule, and it is
      one very rarely infringed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Drawing-room began, I went to my own room and there I had the
      great happiness of finding my father, who had contrived to be in town
      purposely, and to whom I had sent John, in St. Martin's Street, that he
      might be shown the straight way to my apartment. He had determined upon
      going to the Drawing-room himself, to manifest, amongst the general zeal
      of the times, his loyal joy in his majesty's safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room was over very late indeed. So anxious has been the whole
      nation to show their affectionate attachment to the king, that this, the
      first Drawing-room since his danger, was as splendid, and as much crowded,
      as upon a birthday. When the queen summoned me, upon returning to her
      dressing-room, and mentioned how full and how hot it had been, I ventured
      to say, &ldquo;I am very glad of it, ma'am; it was an honest crowd to-day.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE KEEPER OF THE ROBES IS VERY MUCH PUT OUT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At tea I found a new uniform. Major Price, immediately introduced me to
      him; he was Colonel Fairly.<a href="#linknote-210" name="linknoteref-210"
       id="linknoteref-210">[210]</a> He is a man of the most scrupulous
      good-breeding, diffident, gentle, and sentimental in his conversation, and
      assiduously attentive in his manners. He married Lady &mdash;&mdash;, and
      I am told he is a most tender husband to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very unfortunate subject happened to be started during our tea; namely,
      the newspaper attacks upon Mrs. Hastings. The colonel, very innocently,
      said he was very sorry that lady was ever mentioned in the same paragraph
      with her majesty. Mrs. Schwellenberg indignantly demanded &ldquo;Why?&mdash;where?&mdash;when?
      and what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unconscious of her great friendship for Mrs. Hastings, the colonel,
      unfortunately, repeated his concern, adding, &ldquo;Nothing has hurt me so much
      as the queen's being ever named in such company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The most angry defence was now made, but in so great a storm of
      displeasure, and confusion of language, that the colonel, looking utterly
      amazed, was unable to understand what was the matter. Major Price and
      myself were both alarmed; Miss Port longed to laugh; Miss Mawer sat
      perfectly motionless; Mrs. Fisher decidedly silent. No one else was
      present. The colonel, whenever he could be heard, still persisted in his
      assertion, firmly, though gently, explaining the loyalty of his motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      This perseverance increased the storm, which now blew with greater
      violence, less and less distinct as more fierce. Broken sentences were all
      that could be articulated. &ldquo;You might not say such thing!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Upon my
      vord!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I tell you once!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;colonel what-you-call, I am quite
      warm!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Upon my vord!&mdash;I tell you the same!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You might
      not tell me such thing!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What for you say all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing in this that could possibly clear the matter, and the
      poor colonel only sunk deeper and deeper, by not understanding the nature
      of his offence, Major Price now endeavoured to interfere; and, as he is a
      great favourite, he was permitted not only to speak, but to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;those accounts about Mrs. Hastings, and the history
      of her divorce, are very unpleasant anecdotes in public newspapers; and I
      am sorry, too, that they should be told in the same paragraph that
      mentions her being received by the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could equal the consternation with which. This unexpected speech
      was heard. &ldquo;Upon my vord! You sorprise me!&rdquo; was all that could now be got
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I found them now only running further from general comprehension, I
      felt so sorry that poor Mrs. Hastings, whom I believe to be a most injured
      woman, should so ill be defended even by her most zealous friend, that I
      compelled myself to the exertion of coming forward, now, in her behalf
      myself, and I therefore said, it was a thousand pities her story should
      not be more accurately made known: as the mode of a second marriage from a
      divorce was precisely the contrary here of what it was in Germany; since
      here it could only take place upon misconduct, and there, I had been told,
      a divorce from misconduct prohibited a second marriage, which could only
      be permitted where the divorce was the mere effect of disagreement from
      dissimilar tempers. Mrs. Hastings, therefore, though acquitted of
      ill-behaviour by the laws of her own country seemed, by those of England,
      convicted; and I could not but much regret that her vindication was not
      publicly made by this explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, too,&rdquo; cried Major Price &ldquo;for I never heard this before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; cried the colonel &ldquo;and indeed it ought to be made known, both for
      the sake of Mrs. Hastings, and because she has been received at Court,
      which gave everybody the greatest surprise, and me, in my ignorance, the
      greatest concern, on account of the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This undid all again, though my explanation had just stilled the
      hurricane; but now it began afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might not say that, Colonel Fairly; you might not name the queen!&mdash;O,
      I can't bear it!&mdash;I tell you once it is too moch!&mdash;What for you
      tell me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am, I&mdash;I only said&mdash;It is not me, ma'am, but the
      newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for you have such newspapers?&mdash;I tell you the same&mdash;it is&mdash;what
      you call&mdash;I don't like such thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, ma'am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, upon my vord, I might tell you once, when you name the queen, it is&mdash;what
      you call&mdash;I can't bear it!&mdash;when it is nobody else, with all my
      heart! I might not care for that&mdash;but when it is the queen,&mdash;I
      tell you the same, Colonel Fairly&mdash;it makes me&mdash;what you call&mdash;perspire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major again interfered, saying it was now all cleared up, by the
      account of the difference of the German customs, and therefore that it was
      all very well. A certain quiet, but yet decisive way, in which he
      sometimes speaks, was here very successful; and as the lady stopped, the
      colonel saw all explanation too desperate to aim at further argument.

      A JOB'S COMFORTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Aug. 12, Saturday</i>. The Prince of Wales's birthday. How I grieve at
      whatever may be the cause which absents him from his family!&mdash;a
      family of so much love, harmony, and excellence, that to mix with them,
      even rarely, must have been the first of lessons to his heart; and here, I
      am assured, his heart is good, though, elsewhere, his conduct renders it
      so suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I come now to the Oxford expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was to spend one day at Lord Harcourt's, at Nuneham, one at
      Oxford, and one at Blenheim; dining and sleeping always at Nuneham.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now a little regretted that I had declined meeting Lady Harcourt, when
      invited to see her at Mrs. Vesey's about three years ago. I was not, just
      then, very happy&mdash;and I was surfeited of new acquaintances; when the
      invitation, therefore, came, I sent an excuse. But now when I was going to
      her house, I wished I had had any previous knowledge of her, to lessen the
      difficulties of my first appearance in my new character, upon attending
      the queen on a visit. I said something of this sort to Mrs. Schwellenberg,
      in our conversation the day before the journey; and she answered that it
      did not signify for, as I went with the queen, I might be sure I should be
      civilly treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I said, I generally had been; and congratulated myself that at least
      I knew a little of Lord Harcourt, to whom I had been introduced, some
      years ago, at Sir Joshua Reynolds', and whom I had since met two or three
      times. &ldquo;O,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is the same,&mdash;that is nothing,&mdash;when
      you go with the queen, it is enough; they might be civil to you for that
      sake. You might go quite without no, what you call, fuss; you might take
      no gown but what you go in:&mdash;that is enough,&mdash;you might have no
      servant,&mdash;for what?&mdash;You might keep on your riding-dress. There
      is no need you might be seen. I shall do everything that I can to assist
      you to appear for nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I leave you to imagine my thanks. But the news about the servant was not
      very pleasant, as I thought it most likely I could never more want one
      than in a strange house added to a strange situation. However, I
      determined upon assuming no competition in command, and therefore I left
      the matter to her own direction.

    <h2>
      THE JOURNEY To NUNEHAM: UNGRACious RECEPTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Their majesties went to Nuneham to breakfast. Miss Planta and myself were
      not to follow till after an early dinner. Princess Elizabeth, in a
      whisper, after the rest left the room,&mdash;advised me to go and lie down
      again as soon as they were gone. And, indeed, I was sufficiently fatigued
      to be glad to follow the advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Mrs. Delany came to sit with me while I packed up. What a pleasure
      to me is her constant society, and the reciprocal confidence of all our
      conversations! She intrusts me with every thing in the world&mdash;I
      intrust her with every thing that now happens to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our early dinner was with Mrs. Schwellenberg and Miss Mawer. We set out at
      three o'clock, and took with us Mrs. Thielky, the queen's wardrobe woman,
      and the comfort of my life in the absence of Mrs. Schwellenberg, for she
      is the real acting person, though I am the apparent one: and she is also a
      very good sort of woman,&mdash;plain, sensible, clear-headed,
      mild-mannered, sedate, and steady. I found her in this journey of infinite
      service, for she not only did almost every thing for the queen, but made
      it her business to supply also the place of maid to me, as much as ever I
      would suffer her. How fortunate for me that the person so immediately
      under me should be so good a creature! The other person we took was a Miss
      Mhaughendorf, a dresser to the Princesses Royal and Augusta, a very
      pleasing young woman, gentle and interesting, who is just come from the
      king's German dominions to this place, to which she has been recommended
      by her father, who is clerk of the kitchen to the Duke of York. The
      princesses have a German in this office, to assist their study of that
      language, which, in their future destinations, may prove essential to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta's post in the Court-calendar is that of English teacher, but
      it seems to me, that of personal attendant upon the two eldest princesses.
      She is with them always when they sup, work, take their lessons, or walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at Nunebam at about six o'clock. The house is one of those
      straggling, half new, half old, half comfortable, and half forlorn
      mansions, that are begun in one generation and finished in another. It is
      very pleasantly situated, and commands, from some points of view, all the
      towers of Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      In going across the park to the entrance, we saw not a creature. All were
      busy, either in attendance upon the royal guests, or in finding
      hiding-places from whence to peep at them. We stopped at the portico,&mdash;but
      not even a porter was there: we were obliged to get out of the carriage by
      the help of one of the postilions, and to enter the house by the help of
      wet grass, which would not suffer me to stay out of it, otherwise, I felt
      so strange in going in uninvited and unconducted, that I should have
      begged leave to stroll about till somebody appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta, more used to these expeditions, though with quite as little
      taste for them, led the way, and said we had best go and seek for our
      rooms. I was quite of the same opinion, but much at a loss how we might
      find them. We went through various passages, unknowing whither they might
      lead us, till at length we encountered a prodigious fine servant. Miss
      Planta, asked him for Lady Harcourt's maid; he bowed slightly, and passed
      on without making any answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very pleasant this!&mdash;I then begged we might turn back, not caring for
      another adventure of the same sort. Miss Planta complied; and we met two
      more of the yellow-laced saunterers, with whom she had precisely the same
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I never remember to have felt so much shame from my situation as
      at that time. To arrive at a house where no mistress nor master of it
      cared about receiving me; to wander about, a guest uninvited, a visitor
      unthought of; without even a room to go to, a person to inquire for, or
      even a servant to speak to! It was now I felt the real want of either a
      man or maid, to send forward, and find out what we were to do with
      ourselves; and indeed I resolved, then, I would not another time be so
      passive to unauthorized directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fault of this strange reception was certainly in the lady of the
      house, whose affair it was to have given orders, previous to our arrival,
      that some of her people should shew us to whatever apartment she destined
      for us. The queen herself had sent word that we were to attend her; and
      however impossible it was that she could receive us herself, which her own
      attendance upon their majesties made really impracticable, it was
      incumbent upon her to have taken care that we should not have been utterly
      neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strayed thus, backwards and forwards, for a full quarter of an hour, in
      these nearly deserted straggling passages; and then, at length, met a
      French woman, whom Miss Planta immediately seized upon: it was Lady
      Harcourt's woman, and Miss Planta had seen her at Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray shew us,&rdquo; cried Miss Planta, &ldquo;where we are to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was civil, and led us to a parlour looking very pleasantly upon the
      park, and asked if we would have some tea. Miss Planta assented. She told
      us the king and queen were in the park, and left us. As there was a
      garden-door to this room, I thought it very possible the royal party and
      their suite might return to the house that way. This gave great addition
      to my discomposure, for I thought that to see them all in this forlorn
      plight would be still the worst part of the business,&mdash;I therefore
      pressed Miss Planta to let us make another attempt to discover our own
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta laughed exceedingly at my disturbance, but complied very
      obligingly with my request. In this our second wandering forth we had no
      better success than in the first; we either met nobody, or only were
      crossed by such superfine men in laced liveries, that we attempted not to
      question them. My constant dread was Of meeting any of the royal party,
      while I knew not whither to run. Miss Planta, more inured to such
      situations, was not at all surprised by our difficulties and disgraces,
      and only diverted by my distress from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We met at last with Mhaughendorf, and Miss Planta eagerly desired to be
      conducted to the princesses' rooms, that she might see if every thing was
      prepared for them. When they had looked at the apartments destined for the
      princesses, Miss Planta proposed our sitting down to our tea in the
      Princess Elizabeth's room. This was extremely disagreeable to me, as I was
      sensible it must seem a great freedom from me, should her royal highness
      surprise us there; but it was no freedom for Miss Planta, as she had
      belonged to all the princesses these nine years, and is eternally in their
      sight. I could not, therefore, persuade her of the difference; and she
      desired Mhaughendorf to go and order our tea upstairs.

    <h2>
      A HASTY INTRODUCTION To LADY HARCOURT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Planta, followed by poor me, then whisked backwards and forwards,
      from one of the apartments to another, superintending all the
      preparations; and, as we were crossing a landing-place, a lady appeared
      upon the stairs, and Miss Planta called out &ldquo;It's Lady Harcourt,&rdquo; and ran
      down to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked together a few minutes. &ldquo;I must get you, Miss Planta,&rdquo; said
      she, looking up towards me, &ldquo;to introduce me to Miss Burney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then came up the stairs, said she was glad to see me, and desired I
      would order any thing I wanted, either for the queen or for myself. Cold
      enough was my silent curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked again to Miss Planta, who, already knowing her, from seeing her
      frequently when in waiting, as she is one of the ladies of the bedchamber,
      was much more sociable than myself. She afterwards turned to me, and said,
      &ldquo;If there is anything you want, Miss Burney, pray speak for it.&rdquo; And she
      added, &ldquo;My sisters will attend you presently;&mdash;you will excuse me,&mdash;I
      have not a moment from their majesties.&rdquo; And then she curtseyed, and left
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to the Princess Elizabeth's room, and there the tea followed,
      but not the promised sisters. I never saw Miss Planta laugh so heartily
      before nor since; but my dismay was possibly comical to behold.

    <h2>
      APPARITION OF THE PRINCESSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tea was just poured out, when the door opened, and in entered all the
      princesses. I was very much ashamed, and started up, but had no asylum
      whither to run. They all asked us how we did after our journey; and I made
      an apology, as well as I could, to the Princess Elizabeth, for my
      intrusion into her apartment&mdash;confessing I did not know where to find
      my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess royal, eagerly coming up to me, said, &ldquo;I thought you would be
      distressed at first arriving, and I wanted to help you; and I enquired
      where your room was, and said I would look at it myself; and I went round
      to it, but I found the king was that way, and so, you know, I could not go
      past him; but indeed I wished to have seen it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was hardly any thanking her for such infinite sweetness; they then
      desired us to go on with our tea, and went into the princess royal's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now a little revived; and soon after the Princess Elizabeth came
      back, and asked if we had done, desiring us at the same time not to hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we said; and ashamed of thus keeping possession of her room, I was
      gliding out, when she flew to me, and said, &ldquo;Don't go!&mdash;pray come and
      stay with me a little.&rdquo; She then flew to another end of the room, and
      getting a chair, brought it herself close up to me, and seating herself on
      another, said, &ldquo;Come, sit down by me, Miss Burney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may suppose how I resisted and apologised,&mdash;truly telling her
      that I had not opposed her royal highness's design, from being ashamed of
      even suspecting it. She only laughed good-humouredly, and made me take the
      chair she had thus condescended to fetch me. ... In a very few minutes,
      the other princesses came for her. The princess royal then told me she was
      quite sorry to hear we had been so much distressed&mdash;and I found Miss
      Plantabad recounted our adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not glad of this, though greatly gratified by the goodness of the
      princess. But I know how quickly complaints circulate, and I wish not even
      for redress by such means, which commonly, when so obtained, is more
      humiliating than the offence which calls for it.

    <h2>
      FROM PILLAR TO POST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the princesses left us, we were again at a loss what to do with
      ourselves; we saw several passing servants, maids as well as men, and Miss
      Planta applied to them all to shew me my room, which I was anxious to
      inhabit in peace and solitude: however, they all promised to send, some
      one else, but no one came. Miss Planta, in the midst of the diversion she
      received from my unavailing earnestness to get into some retreat, had the
      good-nature to say, &ldquo;I knew how this would turn out, and wished the visit
      over before it began; but it must really be very new to you, unused as you
      are to it, and accustomed to so much attention in other places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length she seized upon a woman servant, who undertook to conduct me to
      this wished-for room. Miss Planta accompanied me, and off we set. In
      descending the stairs, a door opened which led to one of the state rooms,
      in which were the royal family. We glided softly past; but the princess
      royal, attended by the Duchess of Ancaster, came out to us. We soon found
      her royal highness had told our tale. &ldquo;Miss Vernons,&rdquo; said the duchess,
      &ldquo;will come to take care of you; you must both go and take possession of
      the eating-parlour, where you will sup; and the equerries will be of your
      party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said not a word, but of general thanks, still longing only to go to my
      own room. I whispered this to Miss Planta, who obligingly, though rather
      reluctantly, consented to pursue our first scheme. But when the duchess
      observed that we were turning off, she called out, &ldquo;I see you do not know
      your way, so I'll come and show you to the eating-parlour.&rdquo; The princess
      royal said she would come with us also; and, according to direction, we
      were therefore necessitated to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got to the hall leading to this parlour, we were suddenly stopped
      by the appearance of the king, who just then came out of that very room.
      Lord Harcourt attended with a candle in his hand, and a group of gentlemen
      followed. We were advanced too far to retreat, and therefore only stood
      still. The king stopped, and spoke to the Duchess of Ancaster; and then
      spoke very graciously to Miss Planta and me, inquiring when we set out,
      and what sort of journey we had had. He then ascended the stairs, the
      princess royal accompanying him, and all the rest following; the duchess
      first pointing to the door of the eating-parlour, and bidding us go there
      and expect Miss Vernons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Harcourt, during this meeting, had contrived to slip behind the king,
      to make me a very civil bow; and when his majesty moved on, he slid nearer
      me, and whispered a welcome to his house in very civil terms. This was all
      he could do, so situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now entered the eating-room. We sat down,&mdash;but no Miss Vernons!
      Presently the door opened,&mdash;I hoped they were coming,&mdash;but a
      clergyman, a stranger to us both, appeared. This gentleman, I afterwards
      found, was Mr. Hagget, chaplain to Lord Harcourt, and rector of a living
      in his lordship's gift and neighbourhood; a young man, sensible, easy, and
      remarkably handsome, in very high favour with all the family. With nobody
      to introduce us to each other, we could but rise and bow, and curtsey, and
      sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, again the door gave hopes to me of Miss Vernons;&mdash;but
      there only appeared a party of gentlemen. Major Price came foremost, and
      immediately introduced me to General Harcourt. The general is a very shy
      man, with an air of much haughtiness; he bowed and retreated, and sat
      down, and was wholly silent. Colonel Fairly followed him, and taking a
      chair next mine, began some of the civilest speeches imaginable,
      concerning this opportunity of making acquaintance with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then came in a housemaid, and said she would show me my room. I rose
      hastily. Miss Planta, who knew everybody present except the clergyman, was
      now willing to have sat still and chatted; but nothing short of compulsion
      could have kept me in such a situation, and therefore I instantly
      accompanied the maid; and poor Miss Planta could not stay behind. The
      truth is the non-appearance of any of the ladies of the house struck me as
      being so extremely uncivil, that I desired nothing but to retire from all
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt quite relieved when I once took possession of a room that, for the
      time, I might call my own; and I could not possibly listen to Miss
      Planta's desire of returning to the company. I told her frankly that it
      was a situation so utterly disagreeable to me, that I must beg to decline
      placing myself in it again. She was afraid, she said, that, as the Duchess
      of Ancaster had taken the trouble to show us the room, and to tell us what
      to do, in the presence of the princess royal, the queen might hear of our
      absconding, and not be pleased with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must risk that,&rdquo; I answered&mdash;&ldquo;I shall openly tell my reasons, If
      questioned, and I firmly believe they will be satisfactory. If not
      questioned, I shall say nothing; and indeed I very much wish you would do
      the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She agreed,&mdash;consented, rather&mdash;and I was the more obliged to
      her from seeing it was contrary to her inclination. I was sorry, but I
      could not compliment at the expense of putting myself again into a
      situation I had been so earnest to change. Miss Planta bore it very well,
      and only wished the maid farther for never finding us out till we began to
      be comfortable without her.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;THE EQUERRIES WANT THE LADIES.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Here we remained about two hours, unsummoned, unnoticed, unoccupied,&mdash;except
      in forcing open a box which Mrs. Thielky had lent me for my wardrobe, and
      of which I had left the key, ingeniously, at Windsor. At ten o'clock a
      maid came to the door, and said supper was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo; I called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you come from?&rdquo; cried Miss Planta.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gone;&mdash;we could get no answer. About a quarter of an hour
      after, one of those gentlemen footmen, for whom you must already have
      discovered my partiality, called out, from the stairs, without troubling
      himself to come to the door, &ldquo;The supper waits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was already gone; but Miss Planta darted after him, calling out, &ldquo;Who
      sent you?&mdash;who did you come to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not heard by this gentleman, but what she said was echoed after
      him by some other, and the answer that reached our ears was, &ldquo;The
      equerries want the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was enough; Miss Planta returned quite indignant, after hastily
      replying, &ldquo;We don't choose any supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were now precisely of an opinion. Miss Planta, indeed, was much more
      angry than myself; for I was very sure the equerries had sent a very
      different message, and therefore thought nothing of the words used by the
      servant, but confined all my dissatisfaction to its first origin,&mdash;the
      incivility of the ladies of the house, that they came not themselves, or
      some one from them, to invite us in a manner that might be accepted. From
      this time, however, we became more comfortable, as absconding was our
      mutual desire; and we were flung, by this means, into a style of
      sociability we might else never have arrived at.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continued together till Miss Planta thought it right to go and see if
      Mhaughendorf had prepared every thing for the princesses; and then I was
      left to myself&mdash;the very companion I just at that time most wished a
      tete-a-tete with&mdash;till I was summoned to the queen. In this
      tete-a-tete, I determined very concisely upon my plan of procedure: which
      was to quietly keep my own counsel, unless I found my conduct disapproved&mdash;and,
      in that case, to run all risks in openly declaring that I must always
      prefer solitude to society upon terms to which I was unaccustomed.

    <h2>
      SUMMONED TO THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little after the scenes I have described, I was surprised when, late at
      night, my summons was brought me by Lady Harcourt, who tapped gently at my
      door, and made me a little visit, previously to telling me her errand. She
      informed me, also, that the queen had given her command, for Miss Planta
      and me to belong to the suite the next day, in the visit to Oxford; and
      that a carriage was accordingly ordered for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen said not a word to me of the day's adventures and I was glad to
      have them passed over, especially as Lady Harcourt's visit, and the
      civility which accompanied it, appeared a little conscious of remissness.
      But when, in speaking of Oxford, her majesty condescended to ask what gown
      I had brought with me, how did I rejoice to answer, a new chamberry gauze,
      instead of only that which I have on, according to my Cerbera's advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next difficulty was for a hair-dresser. Nuneham is three or four miles
      from Oxford; and I had neither maid to dress nor man to seek a dresser. I
      could only apply to Mrs. Thielky, and she made it her business to prevail
      with one of the royal footmen to get me a messenger, to order a
      hair-dresser from Oxford at six o'clock in the morning. The queen, with
      most gracious consideration, told me, over night, that she should not want
      me till eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended the first night of this excursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Aug. 13.</i>&mdash;At six o'clock my hair-dresser, to my great
      satisfaction, arrived. Full two hours was he at work, yet was I not
      finished, when Swarthy, the queen's hair-dresser, came rapping at my door
      to tell me her majesty's hair was done, and she was waiting for me. I
      hurried as fast as I could, and ran down without any cap. She smiled at
      sight of my hasty attire, and said I should not be distressed about a
      hair-dresser the next day, but employ Swarthy's assistant, as soon as he
      had done with the princesses: &ldquo;You should have had him,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;to-day, if I had known you wanted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When her majesty was dressed, all but the hat, she sent for the three
      princesses&mdash;-and the king came also. I felt very foolish with my
      uncovered head; but it was somewhat the less awkward from its being very
      much a custom, in the royal family, to go without caps; though none that
      appear before them use such a freedom. As soon as the hat was on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss Burney,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;I won't keep you; you had better go
      and dress too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I was dressing, a footman came to my door, with a formal message
      that Miss Vernons begged I would come to breakfast. I immediately promised
      to make haste, glad to find something more resembling civility at length
      coming round to me. Presently after entered Miss Planta, in high spirits
      and great enjoyment. She told me she had been acquainting the queen with
      the whole affair, and that the queen quite approved of our staying
      upstairs. She had been also with the equerries, and had a fine laugh with
      them about their &ldquo;wanting the ladies&rdquo;, they declared they had sent no
      message at all, and that the servant had simply received orders to tell us
      that Miss Vernons desired our company to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it mighty unnecessary to have acquainted the equerries with what
      could only furnish a laugh against ourselves: however, the thing was done,
      and down we went together.

    <h2>
      A CHECK FOR THE COLONEL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two Miss Vernons, General Harcourt, Colonel Fairly, Major Price, and&mdash;Mr.
      Hagget were all at breakfast. The Miss Vernons immediately began an
      apology about the supper the preceding night, declaring themselves
      exceedingly sorry we should not have had any, which they found was
      entirely owing to a blunder in the message given by the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen were all dying to make a laugh about the equerries &ldquo;wanting
      the ladies;&rdquo; and Colonel Fairly began; but the gravity of my behaviour
      soon quieted him. Mr. Hagget was content to be observant of a new person;
      General Harcourt scarce ever speaks but from necessity; and Major Price
      was as grave as myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest Miss Vernon is plain, and a little old-maidish but I found her
      afterwards sensible, well read, and well bred but not quite immediately
      did she appear so, as you will soon see. The youngest is many years her
      junior, and fat and handsome, good-humoured, and pleasing in her smiles,
      though high and distant till they are called forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast, when we were all breaking up, to prepare for church, I
      had a short explanatory conversation with Major Price, who came to speak
      to me concerning the preceding evening, and to confess his extreme
      surprise at our shutting ourselves up from their society. He had had a
      great mind, he said, to have come himself to see for us, but did not know
      whether it would be right. They waited, he added&mdash;Miss Vernons and
      all of them&mdash;a quarter of an hour after the supper was upon the
      table, and then a servant came in from us, to tell the equerries that we
      would not have any supper;&mdash;&ldquo;And, indeed,&rdquo; continued he, a little
      forcibly, &ldquo;I must own I was rather hurt by the message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; cried I,&mdash;&ldquo;what a gentle word!&mdash;I am sure I think you
      might rather have been angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;to own the truth&mdash;I believe I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was interrupted before I could explain more fully how the matter stood;
      nor have I ever found opportunity since. However, I think it very likely
      he suggested the truth himself. Be that as it may, Miss Vernons went for
      their cloaks, and Miss Planta ran to the princesses, and therefore I was
      obliged to be a little abrupt, and retreat also.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Planta was ready, she came to fetch me. We went downstairs, but
      knew not whither to proceed. In the eating-parlour we had left only the
      gentlemen, and they were waiting to attend the king. There was no other
      place to which we could turn, and we had another of those wandering
      distresses that had made me so comfortless the night before. My wish was
      to find Miss Vernons&mdash;my expectation was to be found by them.
      Neither, however, happened; and the first time we met anybody that could
      give us any information, we were told they had been gone some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very agreeable news!

    <h2>
      THANKSGIVING SERVICE; AT NUNEHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I could not, however, bear to give up going to church, for I knew that the
      thanksgiving was to be that morning for the preservation of the king from
      assassination: and to let pique at this unaccountable behaviour, after all
      the apologies just passed, prevent my hearing and joining in a prayer of
      such a nature, in which now I am peculiarly interested, would have been
      ill worth the while. I therefore&mdash;proposed to Miss Planta that we
      should go by ourselves, and desire one of the servants to show us at once
      into Mr. Hagget's pew: for that we had already heard offered to the use of
      Miss Vernons, as Lord Harcourt's was reserved for their majesties. She
      agreed; and we proceeded, following such stragglers as shewed us our way:
      the servant to whom we applied having soon deserted us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church is in a very beautiful situation in the park, and built in the
      form of a Grecian temple. I admired it very much for its plainness and
      elegance. When we got to it, the very first step we took in it shewed us
      the Miss Vernons, very composedly seated in a large pew at the entrance. I
      now led the way, and took a place next to Miss Vernons, as much without
      apology as without invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hagget both read and preached. I was a good deal touched by the
      occasional thanksgiving, chiefly from knowing how much it must affect the
      queen and the princesses. Cause enough, indeed, is there for thanksgiving
      and rejoicing the safety of so mild and exemplary a sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service was over, and the royal family were gone, I thought it
      but right, in such a place, to subdue my proud feelings so far as to say
      to the Miss Vernons, I hoped we had not disturbed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very glad I took this little step down, for Miss Vernon, colouring,
      apologised for not waiting for us, which she said was owing to the fear of
      not getting into the chapel before the royal family. And then she asked if
      we should like to look at the altar-piece, which was the work of Mr.
      Mason.

    <h2>
      ROYAL VISIT TO OXFORD: RECEPTION BY THE UNIVERSITY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      And now for the Oxford expedition.
    </h3>
    <p>
      How many carriages there were, and how they were arranged, I observed not
      sufficiently to recollect; but the party consisted of their majesties, the
      Princesses Royal, Augusta, and Elizabeth, the Duchess of Ancaster, Lord
      and Lady Harcourt, Lady Charlotte Bertie, and the two Miss Vernons. These
      last ladies are daughters of the late Lord Vernon, and sisters of Lady
      Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Harcourt, Colonel Fairly, and Major Price and Mr. Hagget, with
      Miss Planta and myself, completed the group. Miss Planta and I, of course,
      as the only undignified persons, brought up the rear. We were in a chaise
      of Lord Harcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city of Oxford afforded us a very noble view on the road, and its
      spires, towers, and domes soon made me forget all the little objects of
      minor spleen that had been crossing me as I journeyed towards them; and
      indeed, by the time I arrived in the midst of them, their grandeur,
      nobility, antiquity, and elevation impressed my mind so forcibly, that I
      felt for the first time since my new situation had taken place a rushing
      in of ideas that had no connection with it whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roads were lined with decently dressed people, and the high street was
      so crowded we were obliged to drive gently and carefully, to avoid
      trampling the people to death. Yet their behaviour was perfectly
      respectful and proper. Nothing could possibly be better conducted than the
      whole of this expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all drove straight to the theatre<a href="#linknote-211"
       name="linknoteref-211" id="linknoteref-211">[211]</a> in procession. Here,
      in alighting from the carriages, there was some difficulty, on account of
      the pressure of the people to see the king and queen, and princesses:
      however, even then, it was still the genteelest and most decent crowd I
      ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it was that Major Price signalised that part of his character I have
      so strongly marked, of his being truly a gentleman. It was his business to
      attend and guard the king, but he was determined to take almost equal care
      of some of his majesty's subjects: he was everybody's equerry during the
      whole expedition, assisting and looking after every creature, seeing us
      all out of our carriages and into them, and addressing the people, when
      they pressed too forward, with a steadiness and authority that made them
      quicker in retreat than all the staves of all the constables, who were
      attending by dozens at the entrance of every college.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outward gate of the theatre, the vice-chancellor, Dr. Chapman,
      received their majesties. All the professors, doctors, etc., then in
      Oxford, arrayed in their professional robes, attended him.&mdash;How I
      wished my dear father amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vice-chancellor then conducted their majesties along the inner court,
      to the door of the theatre, all the rest following; and there, waiting
      their arrival, stood the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, the Marquis of
      Blandford, in a nobleman's Oxford robe, and Lady Caroline and Lady
      Elizabeth Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had all paid their duties, a regular procession followed, which
      I should have thought very pretty, and much have liked to have seen, had I
      been a mere looker on; but was frequently at a loss, what to do with
      myself, and uncertain whether I ought to proceed in the suite, or stand by
      as a spectator; and Miss Planta was still, if possible, more fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatre was filled with company, all well dressed, and arranged in
      rows around it. The area below them was entirely empty, so that there was
      not the least confusion. The chancellor's chair, at the head of about a
      dozen steps, was prepared for the king; and just below him, to his left, a
      form for the queen and the princesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king walked foremost from the area, conducted by the University's
      vice-chancellor. The queen followed, handed by her own vice-chamberlain.
      The Princess royal followed, led by the king's aide-de-camp, General
      Harcourt; and Princess Augusta, leaning on Major Price. Princess Elizabeth
      walked alone, no other servant of the king being present, and no rank
      authorising such a conduct, without office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next followed the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough; then the Duchess of
      Ancaster, and Marquis of Blandford&mdash;next, Lord and Lady Harcourt,
      then the two Lady Spencers and Lady Charlotte Bertie, then the Miss
      Vernons, and then Miss Planta and a certain F. B. .
    </p>
    <p>
      We were no sooner arranged, and the door of the theatre shut, than the
      king, his head covered, sat down; the queen did the same, and then the
      three princesses. All the rest, throughout the theatre, stood.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      THE ROYAL FAMILY ARE MUCH AFFECTED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The vice-chancellor then made a low obeisance to the king, and producing a
      written paper, began the address of the University, to thank his majesty
      for this second visit, and to congratulate him and the nation on his late
      escape from assassination. He read it in an audible and distinct voice;
      and in its conclusion, an address was suddenly made to the queen,
      expressive of much concern for her late distress, and the highest and most
      profound veneration for her amiable and exalted character.
    </p>
    <p>
      An address, to me so unexpected, and on a subject so recent and of so near
      concern, in presence of the person preserved, his wife, and his children,
      was infinitely touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen could scarcely bear it, though she had already, I doubt not,
      heard it at Nuneham, as these addresses must be first read in private, to
      have the answers prepared. Nevertheless, this public tribute of loyalty to
      the king, and of respect to herself, went gratefully to her heart, and
      filled her eyes with tears&mdash;which she would not, however, encourage,
      but smiling through them, dispersed them with her fan, with which she was
      repeatedly obliged to stop their Course down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princesses, less guarded, the moment their father's danger was
      mentioned, wept with but little control; and no wonder, for I question if
      there was one dry eye in the theatre. The tribute, so just, so honourable,
      so elegant, paid to the exalted character of the queen, affected
      everybody, with joy for her escape from affliction, and with delight at
      the reward and the avowal of her virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the address was ended, the king took a paper from Lord Harcourt, and
      read his answer. The king reads admirably; with ease, feeling, and force,
      and without any hesitation. His voice is particularly full and fine. I was
      very much surprised by its effect. When he had done, he took off his hat,
      and bowed to the chancellor and professors, and delivered the answer to
      Lord Harcourt, who, walking backwards, descended the stairs, and presented
      it to the vice chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this ceremony was so perfectly new to me, that I rejoiced extremely in
      not missing it. Indeed I would not have given up the pleasure of seeing
      the queen on this occasion for any sort of sight that could have been
      exhibited to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next followed music: a good organ, very well played, anthem-ed and
      voluntary-ed us for some time.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      THE PRESENTATIONS: RETIRING BACKWARDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After this, the vice-chancellor and professors begged for the honour of
      kissing the king's hand. Lord Harcourt was again the backward messenger;
      and here followed a great mark of goodness in the king: he saw that
      nothing less than a thoroughbred old courtier, such as Lord Harcourt,
      could walk backwards down these steps, before himself, and in sight of so
      full a hall of spectators&mdash;-and he therefore dispensed with being
      approached to his seat, and walked down himself into the area, where the
      vice-chancellor kissed his hand, and was imitated by every professor and
      doctor in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this considerate good-nature in his majesty, the sight, at
      times, was very ridiculous. Some of the worthy collegiates, unused to such
      ceremonies, and unaccustomed to such a presence, the moment they had
      kissed the king's hand, turned their backs to him, and walked away as in
      any common room; others, attempting to do better, did still worse, by
      tottering and stumbling, and falling foul of those behind them some,
      ashamed to kneel, took the king's hand straight up to their mouths;
      others, equally off their guard, plumped down on both knees, and could
      hardly get up again; and many, in their confusion, fairly arose by pulling
      his majesty's hand to raise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the king spoke to every one, upon Lord Harcourt's presenting them, this
      ceremonial took up a good deal of time but it was too new and diverting to
      appear long.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was vacation time; there were therefore none of the students present.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the whole was over, we left the theatre in the same form we had
      entered it. The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, the Marquis and the
      Ladies Spencer, attended the king and queen to their carriages, and then
      went back to the theatre, to wait for their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot now go on with our progress regularly, for I do not remember it.
      I will only, therefore, in general, say, that I was quite delighted with
      the city, and so entertained and so pleased with such noble buildings as
      it presented to me, that I felt, as I have told you, a consciousness to
      pleasure revived in me, which had long lain nearly dormant.

    <h2>
      THE COLLEGES VISITED: A STEALTHY COLLATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We went to all the colleges in the same order that we came to the theatre.
      I shall attempt no descriptions; I shall only mention a few little
      personal circumstances, and some of those court etiquettes which, from
      their novelty to me, will, I judge, be new also to my Susan; and what is
      new in customs or manners is always worth knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Christ-church college, when we arrived at about three o'clock, in a
      large hall there was a cold collation prepared for their majesties and the
      princesses. It was at the upper end of the hall. I could not see of what
      it consisted, though it would have been very agreeable, after so much
      standing and sauntering, to have given my opinion of it in an experimental
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their majesties and the princesses sat down to this table&mdash;-as well
      satisfied, I believe, as any of their subjects so to do. Duchess of
      Ancaster and Lady Harcourt stood behind the chairs of the queen and the
      princess royal. There were 11, other ladies of sufficient rank to
      officiate for Princesses Augusta and Elizabeth. Lord Harcourt stood behind
      the king's chair and the vice-chancellor, and the head master of
      Christ-church' with salvers in their hands, stood near the table, and
      ready to hand, to the three noble waiters, whatever was wanted: while the
      other reverend doctors and learned professors stood aloof, equally ready
      to present to the chancellor and the master whatever they were to forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      We, meanwhile, untitled attendants, stood at the other end of the room,
      forming a semi-circle, and all strictly facing the royal collationers. We
      consisted of the Miss Vernons, thrown out here as much as their humble
      guests&mdash;Colonel Fairly, Major Price, General Harcourt, and,&mdash;though
      I know not why,&mdash;Lady Charlotte Bertie;&mdash;with all the inferior
      professors, in their gowns, and some, too much frightened to advance, of
      the upper degrees. These, with Miss Planta, Mr. Hagget, and myself, formed
      this attendant semi-circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of this collation was spent very pleasantly&mdash;to me, at
      least, to whom the novelty of the scene rendered it entertaining. It was
      agreed that we must all be absolutely famished unless we could partake of
      some refreshment, as we had breakfasted early, and had no chance of dining
      before six or seven o'clock. A whisper was soon buzzed through the
      semi-circle, of the deplorable state of our appetite apprehensions; and
      presently it reached the ears of some of the worthy doctors. Immediately a
      new whisper was circulated, which made its progress with great vivacity,
      to offer us whatever we would wish, and to beg us to name what we chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea, coffee, and chocolate, were whispered back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method of producing, and the means of swallowing them, were much more
      difficult to settle than the choice of what was acceptable. Major Price
      and Colonel Fairly, however, seeing a very large table close to the
      wainscot behind us, desired our refreshments might be privately conveyed
      there, behind the semi-circle, and that, while all the group backed very
      near it, one at a time might feed, screened by all the rest from
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I need not inform you, my dear Susan, that to eat in presence of
      any of the royal family is as much hors d'usage as to be seated. This plan
      had speedy success, and the very good doctors soon, by sly degrees and
      with watchful caution, covered the whole table with tea, coffee,
      chocolate, cakes, and bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The further plan, however, of one at a time feasting and the rest fasting
      and standing sentinels, was not equally approved; there was too much
      eagerness to seize the present moment, and too much fear of a sudden
      retreat, to give patience for so slow proceeding. We could do no more,
      therefore, than stand in double row, with one to screen one throughout the
      troop; and, in this manner, we were all very plentifully and very
      pleasantly served.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Ancaster and Lady Harcourt, as soon as the first serving
      attendance was over, were dismissed from the royal chairs, and most happy
      to join our group, and partake of our repast. The duchess, extremely
      fatigued with standing, drew a small body of troops before her, that she
      might take a few minutes' rest on a form by one of the doors; and Lady
      Charlotte Bertie did the same, to relieve an ankle which she had
      unfortunately sprained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried the good-natured duchess, &ldquo;I wish she could sit
      down, for she is unused to this work. She does not know yet what it is to
      stand for five hours following, as we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful window of Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr. Jervis, in New
      College, would alone have recovered me, had my fatigue been infinitely
      more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the colleges I stayed so long in an old chapel, lingering over
      antique monuments, that all the party were vanished before I missed them,
      except doctors and professors; for we had a train of those everywhere; and
      I was then a little surprised by the approach of one of them, saying, &ldquo;You
      seem inclined to abide with us, Miss Burney?&rdquo;&mdash;and then another, in
      an accent of facetious gallantry, cried, &ldquo;No, no, don't let us shut up
      Miss Burney among old tombs!&mdash;No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, many of the good doctors occasionally spoke to me, when there
      happened to be opportunity. How often did I wish my dear father amongst
      them! They considered me as a doctor's daughter, and were all most
      excessively courteous, handing, and pointing, and showing me about as much
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another college, while Miss Planta and myself were hanging a little
      back, at the entrance into a small cedar chapel, that would not much more
      than hold the royal family and their immediate suite, the Duchess of
      Ancaster, who took every opportunity to show me civilities, and
      distinguish me, came down the steps, and made me ascend them, to turn with
      her, when she called to her daughter, and in the most obliging terms
      introduced me to her, with many kind speeches of her wish that we should
      cultivate much acquaintance. Lady Charlotte is very handsome, and has a
      very good figure: she unfortunately lisps very much, which, at first,
      never prejudices in favour of the understanding; but I have conversed with
      her too little to know anything more of her than that she is well bred,
      and seems to have a large portion internally, of the good-natured and
      obliging disposition of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Town-hall, an address was presented by the mayor and corporation of
      the city of Oxford to the king, which the mayor read, while the same
      ceremony of the sitting and standing was practised that I have described
      at the theatre. The king took off his hat, and bowed, and received the
      address, after hearing it, but returned no answer. Nor has his majesty
      made any except to the Oxford University, though they have, since, poured
      in upon him from every part of the kingdom. The mayor was then knighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it was in Trinity college that we saw the noblest library I have
      ever happened to enter. For 'tis but little, my dear Susan, I have seen of
      sights. Here we had new court scenery, in which I acted but an
      uncourtier-like part. The queen and princess had seats prepared for them,
      which, after a stroll up and down the library, they were glad, I believe,
      to occupy. The ladies of their suite were then graciously ordered by her
      majesty to be seated, as there was not here the state or public appearance
      that was observed at the theatre, and in the college where the
      refreshments were given. As to the poor men, they never must sit in the
      presence of the queen, be they whom they will, or what they will: so they
      were fain to stand it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta glided away, behind a pillar, and, being there unseen, was
      able to lounge a little. She was dreadfully tired. So was everybody but
      myself. For me, my curiosity was so awake to every thing, that I seemed
      insensible to all inconvenience. I could not, in such a library, prevail
      with myself to so modest a retirement as Miss Planta's: I considered that
      the queen had herself ordered my attendance in this expedition, and I
      thought myself very well privileged to make it as pleasant as I could. I
      therefore stole softly down the room, to the further end, and there amused
      myself with examining what books were within reach of my eyes, and with
      taking down and looking into all such as were also within reach of my
      understanding. This was very pleasant sport to me, and had we stayed there
      till midnight would have kept me from weariness.

    <h2>
      RETREATING FROM THE ROYAL PRESENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In another college (we saw so many, and in such quick succession, that I
      recollect not any by name, though all by situation) I saw a performance of
      courtly etiquette, by Lady Charlotte Bertie, that seemed to me as
      difficult as any feat I ever beheld, even at Astley's or Hughes's. It was
      in an extremely large, long, spacious apartment. The king always led the
      way out, as well as in, upon all entrances and exits: but here, for some
      reason that I know not, the queen was handed out first; and the
      princesses, and the aide-de-camp, and equerry followed. The king was very
      earnest in conversation with some professor; the attendants hesitated
      whether to wait or follow the queen; but presently the Duchess of
      Ancaster, being near the door, slipped out, and Lady Harcourt after her.
      The Miss Vernons, who were but a few steps from them, went next. But Lady
      Charlotte, by chance, happened to be very high up the room, and near to
      the king. Had I been in her situation, I had surely waited till his
      majesty went first&mdash;but that would not, I saw, upon this occasion,
      have been etiquette she therefore faced the king, and began a march
      backwards,&mdash;her ankle already sprained, and to walk forward, and even
      leaning upon an arm, was painful to her: nevertheless, back she went,
      perfectly upright, without one stumble, without ever looking once behind
      to see what she might encounter; and with as graceful a motion, and as
      easy an air, as I ever saw anybody enter a long room, she retreated, I am
      sure, full twenty yards backwards out of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, I was also, unluckily, at the upper end of the room, looking at
      some portraits of founders, and one of Henry VIII. in particular, from
      Holbein. However, as soon as I perceived what was going forward,&mdash;backward,
      rather,&mdash;I glided near the wainscot, (Lady Charlotte, I should
      mention, made her retreat along the very middle of the room,) and having
      paced a few steps backwards, stopped short to recover, and, while I seemed
      examining some other portrait, disentangled my train from the heels of my
      shoes, and then proceeded a few steps only more&mdash;and then, observing
      the king turn another way, I slipped a yard or two at a time forwards&mdash;and
      hastily looked back, and then was able to go again according to rule, and
      in this manner, by slow and varying means, I at length made my escape.
      Miss Planta stood upon less ceremony, and fairly ran off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that time, however, I have come on prodigiously, by constant
      practice, in the power and skill of walking backwards, without tripping up
      my own heels, feeling my head giddy, or treading my train out of the
      plaits&mdash;accidents very frequent among novices in that business; and I
      have no doubt but that, in the course of a few months, I shall arrive at
      all possible perfection in the true Court retrograde motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another college, in an old chapter house, I had the opportunity to see
      another Court-scene. It was nearly round in shape, and had various old
      images and ornaments. We were all taken in by the doctors attendant, and
      the party, with doctors and all, nearly filled it; but, finding it
      crowded, everybody stood upon the less ceremony, and we all made our
      examinations of the various contents of the room quite at our ease: till
      suddenly the king and queen, perceiving two very heavy old-fashioned
      chairs were placed at the head of the room for their reception, graciously
      accepted them, and sat down. Nothing could exceed the celerity with which
      all confusion instantly was over, and the most solemn order succeeded to
      it. Chairs were presented to the three princesses by the side of the
      queen, and the Duchess of Ancaster and Lady Harcourt planted themselves at
      their backs; while Lady Charlotte instantly retreated close to the wall,
      and so did every creature else in the room, all according to their rank or
      station, and the royal family remained conspicuous and alone, all crowd
      dispersed, and the space of almost the whole room unoccupied before them,
      so close to the walls did every body respectfully stand.

    <h2>
      SURPRISED BY THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last college we visited was Cardinal Wolsey's&mdash;an immense fabric.
      While roving about a very spacious apartment, Mr. Fairly<a
      href="#linknote-212" name="linknoteref-212" id="linknoteref-212">[212]</a>
      came behind me, and whispered that I might easily slip out into a small
      parlour, to rest a little while; almost everybody having taken some
      opportunity to contrive themselves a little sitting but myself. I assured
      him, very truly, I was too little tired to make it worth while; but poor
      Miss Planta was so woefully fatigued that I could not, upon her account,
      refuse to be of the party. He conducted us into a very neat little
      parlour, belonging to the master of the college, and Miss Planta flung
      herself on a chair, half dead with weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly was glad of the opportunity to sit for a moment also; for 'my
      part, I was quite alert. Alas! my dear Susan, 'tis my mind that is so
      weak, and so open to disorder;&mdash;my body, I really find, when it is an
      independent person, very strong, and capable of much exertion without
      suffering from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly now produced, from a paper repository concealed in his coat
      pocket, some apricots and bread, and insisted upon my eating&mdash;but I
      was not inclined to the repast, and saw he was half famished himself&mdash;so
      was poor Miss Planta: however, he was so persuaded I must both be as
      hungry and as tired as himself, that I was forced to eat an apricot to
      appease him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, while we were in the midst of this regale, the door suddenly
      opened, and the queen came in!&mdash;followed by as many attendants as the
      room would contain. Up we all started, myself alone not discountenanced;
      for I really think it quite respect-sufficient never to sit down in the
      royal presence, without aiming at having it supposed I have stood bolt
      upright ever since I have been admitted to it. Quick into our pockets was
      crammed our bread, and close into our hands was squeezed our fruit; by
      which I discovered that our appetites were to be supposed annihilated, at
      the same time that our strength was to be invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon after this we were joined by the king, and in a few minutes we
      all paraded forth to the carriages, and drove back to Nuneham.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been very minute in this Oxford account, because it presented
      scenes so new to me, and because I concluded that, after you have had a
      month or two of general journal, you will have nothing more to be new to
      either of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Oxford expedition was, altogether, highly entertaining to me; but I
      ought not to close it without telling you the sweetness of all the
      princesses, who each made a point of speaking to, Miss Planta and to me
      upon entering or quitting every college, as we stood in the ranks, while
      they passed.

    <h2>
      AT NUNEHAM AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I stayed in my own room till a message from the Miss Vernons brought me
      down to dinner; and from this time forward those ladies exerted themselves
      to the utmost in being attentive, sociable, and civil. I found the major,
      Mr. Fairly Mr. Hagget, Miss Planta, and themselves; and we had a very
      pleasant dinner, talking over the sights just seen. All the afternoon was
      spent in the same party. We went into Lord Harcourt's library to tea and
      coffee, and there we had short visits from his lordship and the Duchess of
      Ancaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Lady Harcourt came also, and was amazingly courteous. The
      queen then sent for the Miss Vernons into the drawing-room, and Miss
      Planta and myself left the gentlemen to take care of themselves, and
      retired for the evening to our own rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know, wherever the king and queen are, nobody comes into their
      sight unsent for, not even the master and mistress of the house, unless
      they are publicly acquainted that their majesties are coming, and mean to
      see them.

    <h2>
      A LIVELY BREAKFAST INCIDENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Monday, Aug. 14.</i>&mdash;I come now to introduce to you a new
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not get down to breakfast till it was almost over, as I was detained
      with the queen, and as everybody was obliged to make what haste they
      could, in order to insure a meal before a summons. I found Miss Planta,
      and the aide-de-camp, vice chamberlain, and equerry; Lady Harcourt had
      already breakfasted with them, but made off as soon as the queen was
      visible, to wait upon her majesty. Miss Vernons lay in bed from
      yesterday's fatigues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extreme silence and gravity of the aide-de-camp threw a reserve and
      constraint on all the party, and we were all nearly dumb, when a new lady
      suddenly rushed into the room. This was Mrs. Harcourt, the aide-de-camp's
      wife, who had been ill the preceding day, and therefore had not ventured
      to Oxford. She is a showy, handsome woman, extremely talkative, with quick
      parts, high spirits, and a rattling vein of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta, who had taken Lady Harcourt's place, in order to pour out the
      tea, instantly moved to another. Mrs. Harcourt hurried into that just
      vacated, without ceremony, calling out, &ldquo;How monstrous late you all are!&mdash;though
      I need not talk, for I hate getting up early. I was so vastly ill
      yesterday I could not stir, but I am vastly well to-day, so I am going to
      Blenheim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This day had been previously dedicated to seeing Blenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Blenheim?&rdquo; repeated General Harcourt, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, to Blenheim! So no grave faces, for my plan is fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He half articulated a fear of her being ill again, but she stopped him
      with &ldquo;O, no matter, leave that to the Fates;&mdash;the queen has been so
      gracious as to say I may go, and therefore go I shall: so say nothing
      about it, for that's settled and unalterable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After being so ill yesterday,&rdquo; said Mr. Fairly, &ldquo;I think it will be
      rather too much for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&mdash;and what's more, you must carry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;if go you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I will, certainly; and some of you must take me. I have no
      coach ordered,-and there is not one to spare: so, amongst you, you
      equerries, you must carry me. I have never been to Blenheim since I
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you before?&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and you took me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, you had that honour; and I think you have never taken that
      trouble since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this, though uttered in a voice as peremptory as the language, was
      spoken with very becoming smiles, and an air of saucy good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast all this while had stood quite still: indeed there was
      nobody but myself that had not nearly done. Major Price handed me roll and
      butter and bread across the table, by way of hint, I believe; all which I
      declined: at last Mr. Fairly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, which is your cup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Mrs. Harcourt, abruptly turning to me, exclaimed &ldquo;O dear,
      you've got no tea!&rdquo; Then pouring out a dish of slop, added, &ldquo;Can you drink
      it? It looks very melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have had enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Have not you also, my Susan, had enough of this scene?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blenheim visit being considered as a private one, nobody went but of
      the Marlborough acquaintance: though in all royal parties, the whole
      company is always named by the royals, and the lords and ladies of the
      mansions have no more right to invite a guest than a guest has to come
      uninvited.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent this day very pleasantly, in walking over the grounds which are
      extremely pretty, seeing a flower-garden planned by Mr. Mason, and the
      pictures in the house. The two Miss Vernons, Miss Planta, and Mr. Hagget,
      were all that remained at Nuneham. And it was now I wholly made peace with
      those two ladies; especially the eldest, as I found her, the moment she
      was removed from rays so bright that they had dazzled her, a rational,
      composed, obliging woman. She took infinite and unwearied pains to make
      amends for the cold and strange opening of our acquaintance, by the most
      assiduous endeavours to give me pleasure and amusement. And she succeeded
      very well. I could blame nobody but the countess' sister for our
      reception; I plainly saw these ladies had been unprepared to look upon us
      as any charge to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal excursioners did not return till between six and seven o'clock,
      when we dined with the same party as the preceding day. The evening, too,
      had just the same visitors, and passed in just the same manner.

      COURT DUTIES AT WINDSOR AND KEW.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [The following section and the two sections which succeed
     it, relate, almost exclusively, to Fanny's dreary prison-
     life in the royal household.  Of the world without the
     palace, of the friends whom she had left, we hear next to
     nothing.  The change for her was complete; the rare visits
     of her father, her sister, and the Lockes, one hasty
     excursion to Chesington, and one delightful evening at Mrs.
     Ord's, form nearly the sum total of her personal
     intercourse, during these eighteen months, with those whose
     kindness and sympathy had brightened her past years.  She
     complained seldom, and only to her best-beloved Susan, but
     there is something truly pathetic in these occasional
     evidences of the struggle which she was making to conquer
     her repugnance, and to be happy, if that were possible, in
     her new situation.  Dazzled by the royal condescension Fanny
     may have been; blinded she was not.  It was her father who,
     possessed by a strange infatuation, remained blind to the
     incongruity, charmed by the fancied honour, of his
     daughter's position; and she, tender-hearted as she was,
     could not bear to inflict upon one so dear the pain which
     she knew must be the consequence of his enlightenment.
     Meanwhile, her best comfort was still in the friendship of
     Mrs. Delany, and this, in the course of nature, could not be
     of long duration.

     But dreary as this life of routine was to the unfortunate
     victim, we venture to assure the reader that he will find
     the victim's account of it very far from dreary.  Indeed,
     these pages might almost be instanced to show from what
     unpromising materials a person endowed with humour and
     observation can construct a singularly entertaining
     narrative.  Our wonder is that neither the monotony of her
     official duties, nor the insipidity of her associates, nor
     even the odious tyranny of her colleague, could wholly
     subdue in the author of &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; that bright
     and humorous disposition to which the following pages bear
     frequent testimony.&mdash;ED.]

      THE MISCHIEF-MAKING KEEPER OF THE ROBES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday, Aug. 15.</i>&mdash;This morning we all breakfasted together,
      and at about twelve o'clock we set off again for Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Harcourt came into the breakfast room with abundance of civil
      speeches upon his pleasure in renewing our acquaintance, and the Miss
      Vernons parted with me like wholly different people from those I met.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I returned to the queen's Lodge at Windsor, I called upon Mrs.
      Schwellenberg. I found her still occupied concerning the newspaper
      business about Mrs. Hastings. She was more than ever irritated against Mr.
      Fairly for his information, and told me she was sure he must have said it
      to her on purpose, and that she wished people might hold their tongue: but
      that she was bent upon having satisfaction, and therefore she had sent for
      Mrs. Hastings, and informed her of the whole business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not only sorry, but frightened, lest any mischief should arise
      through misrepresentations and blunders, between Mr. Fairly and Mr.
      Hastings: however, this imprudent step was taken already, and not to be
      called back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She protested she was determined to insist that Mr. Fairly should produce
      the very paper that had mentioned the queen, which she should show, and
      have properly noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, on the other side, instantly resolved to speak myself to Mr. Fairly, to
      caution him by no means to be led into seeking any such paper, or into
      keeping such a search awake; for, with the best intentions in the world, I
      saw him on the point of being made the object of vindictive resentment to
      Mr. Hastings, or of indignant displeasure to the queen herself,&mdash;so
      wide-spreading is the power of misapprehension over the most innocent
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw, however, nothing of Mr. Fairly till tea-time; indeed, except by
      very rare chance, I never see any of the king's people but at that
      meeting. Mrs. Schwellenberg was then present, and nothing could I do.
      Major Price and Mr. Fisher were of the party. Mr. Fairly fortunately had
      letters to write, and hastily left us, after taking one dish of tea. The
      moment he was gone Mrs. Schwellenberg said she had forgot to speak to him
      about the newspaper, and told Major Price to ask him for it. Major Price
      assented with a bow only, and the matter dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, however, who best knew the danger of its going any farther, now
      determined upon speaking to Major Price, and making him contrive to hush
      it up. Utterly impossible, nevertheless, proved this scheme; Major Price
      was too great a favourite to be an instant disengaged. I was obliged,
      therefore, to be quiet.

    <h2>
      A TERRACE PARTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday, Aug. 16</i>&mdash;Was the birthday of Prince Frederick, Duke
      of York. The queen sent me in the morning to my dear Mrs. Delany, whom I
      had but just found a moment to fly to the preceding day, and I was
      commanded to bring&mdash;her, if well enough, just as she was, in her home
      morning dress, to her majesty. This I did with great delight; and that
      most venerable of women accepted the invitation with all the alacrity of
      pleasure she could have felt at fifteen. The queen, in the late excursion,
      had made many purchases at Woodstock: and she now made some little
      presents from them to this dear lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, as it was again a birthday, I resolved upon going to the
      Terrace, as did Mrs. Delany, and with her and Miss Mawer, and Miss Port, I
      sallied forth. To avoid the high steps leading to the Terrace from the
      Lodge, we went through a part of the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Terrace was much crowded, though so windy we could hardly keep our
      feet; but I had an agreeable surprise in meeting there with Dr. Warton.<a
      href="#linknote-213" name="linknoteref-213" id="linknoteref-213">[213]</a>
      He joined Mrs. Delany instantly, and kept with us during the whole walk.
      He congratulated me upon my appointment, in terms of rapture; his
      ecstacies are excited so readily, from the excessive warmth of his
      disposition, and its proneness to admire and wonder, that my new situation
      was a subject to awaken an enthusiasm the most high-flown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently after we were joined by a goodly priest, fat, jovial, breathing
      plenty ease, and good living. I soon heard him whisper Mrs. Delany to
      introduce him to me. It was Dr. Roberts, provost of Eton: I had already
      seen him at Mrs. Delany's last winter, but no introduction had then
      passed. He is a distant relation of Mr. Cambridge. His wife was with him,
      and introduced also.
    </p>
    <p>
      These also joined us; and in a few minutes more a thin, little, wizen old
      gentleman, with eyes that scarce seemed to see, and a rather tottering
      gait, came up to Mrs. Delany, and after talking with her some time, said
      in a half whisper, &ldquo;Is that Miss Burney?&rdquo; and then desired a presentation.
      It was Mr. Bryant, the mythologist.<a href="#linknote-214"
       name="linknoteref-214" id="linknoteref-214">[214]</a> I was very glad to
      see him, as he bears a very high character, and lives much in this
      neighbourhood. He talks a great deal, and with the utmost good humour and
      ease, casting entirely aside his learning, which I am, nevertheless,
      assured is that of one of the most eminent scholars of the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now a very good party, and seated ourselves in a sort of alcove, to
      be sheltered from the wind; but it was so very violent that it deterred
      the royal family from walking. They merely came on the Terrace to show
      themselves to those who were eager to pay their compliments upon the day,
      and then returned to the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Warton insisted upon accompanying me home as far as the iron rails, to
      see me enter my royal premises. I did not dare invite him in, without
      previous knowledge whether I had any such privilege; otherwise, with all
      his parts, and all his experience, I question whether there is one boy in
      his school at Winchester who would more have delighted in feeling himself
      under the roof of a sovereign.

    <h2>
      A NERVOUS READER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Aug. 17.</i>&mdash;From the time that the queen condescended to desire
      to place me in immediate attendance upon her own person, I had always
      secretly concluded she meant me for her English reader; since the real
      duties of my office would have had a far greater promise of being
      fulfilled by thousands of others than by myself. This idea had made the
      prospect of reading to her extremely awful to me: an exhibition, at any
      rate, is painful to me, but one in which I considered her majesty as a
      judge, interested for herself in the sentence she should pronounce, and
      gratified or disappointed according to its tenor&mdash;this was an
      exhibition formidable indeed, and must have been considered as such by
      anybody in similar circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a book, not a pamphlet, not a newspaper, had I ever seen near the
      queen, for the first week, without feeling a panic; I always expected to
      be called upon. She frequently bid me give her the papers; I felt that
      they would be the worst reading I could have, because full of danger, in
      matter as well as manner: however, she always read them herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, after she was dressed, Mrs. Schwellenberg went to her own room;
      and the queen, instead of leaving me, as usual, to go to mine, desired me
      to follow her to her sitting dressing-room. She then employed me in
      helping her to arrange her work, which is chair covers done in ribbon; and
      then told me to fetch her a volume of the &ldquo;Spectator.&rdquo; I obeyed with
      perfect tranquillity. She let me stand by her a little while without
      speaking, and then, suddenly, but very gently, said, &ldquo;Will you read a
      paper while I work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was quite &ldquo;consternated!&rdquo; I had not then the smallest expectation of
      such a request. I said nothing, and held the book unopened.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it from me, and pointed out the place where I should begin. She
      is reading them regularly through, for the first time. I had no choice: I
      was forced to obey; but my voice was less obedient than my will, and it
      became so husky, and so unmanageable, that nothing more unpleasant could
      be heard. The paper was a curious one enough&mdash;all concerning a Court
      favourite. I could hardly rejoice when my task was over, from my
      consciousness how ill it was performed. The queen talked of the paper, but
      forbore saying anything of any sort about the reader. I am sorry, however,
      to have done so ill.

      FANNY BURNEY TO MRS. PHILIPS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>August 20.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      ... O my beloved Susan, 'tis a refractory heart I have to deal with!&mdash;it
      struggles so hard to be sad&mdash;and silent&mdash;and fly from you
      entirely, since it cannot fly entirely to you. I do all I can to conquer
      it, to content it, to give it a taste and enjoyment for what is still
      attainable: but at times I cannot manage it, and it seems absolutely
      indispensable to my peace to occupy myself in anything rather than in
      writing to the person most dear to me upon earth!... If to you alone I
      show myself in these dark colours, can you blame the plan that I have
      intentionally been forming, namely, to wean myself from myself&mdash;to
      lessen all my affections&mdash;to curb all my wishes&mdash;to deaden all
      my sensations? This design, my Susan, I formed so long ago as the first
      day my dear father accepted my offered appointment: I thought that what
      demanded a complete new system of life, required, if attainable, a new set
      of feelings for all enjoyment of new prospects, and for lessening regrets
      at what were quitted, or lost. Such being my primitive idea, merely from
      my grief of separation, imagine but how it was strengthened and confirmed
      when the interior of my position became known to me!&mdash;when I saw
      myself expected by Mrs. Schwellenberg, not to be her colleague, but her
      dependent deputy! not to be her visitor at my own option, but her
      companion, her humble companion, at her own command! This has given so new
      a character to the place I had accepted under such different auspices,
      that nothing but my horror of disappointing, perhaps displeasing, my
      dearest father, has deterred me from the moment that I made this
      mortifying discovery, from soliciting his leave to resign.
    </p>
    <p>
      But oh my Susan,&mdash;kind, good, indulgent as he is to me, I have not
      the heart so cruelly to thwart his hopes&mdash;his views&mdash;his
      happiness, in the honours he conceived awaiting my so unsolicited
      appointment. The queen, too, is all sweetness, encouragement, and gracious
      goodness to me, and I cannot endure to complain to her of her old servant.
      You see, then, my situation; here I must remain!&mdash;The die is cast,
      and that struggle is no more.&mdash;To keep off every other, to support
      the loss of the dearest friends, and best society, and bear, in exchange,
      the tyranny, the exigeance, the ennui, and attempted indignities of their
      greatest contrast,&mdash;this must be my constant endeavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst my sources of unhappiness in this extraordinary case is, the very
      favour that, in any other, might counteract it&mdash;namely, that of the
      queen: for while, in a manner the most attractive, she seems inviting my
      confidence, and deigning to wish my happiness, she redoubles my conflicts
      never to shock her with murmurs against one who, however to me noxious and
      persecuting, is to her a faithful and truly devoted old servant. This will
      prevent my ever having my distress and disturbance redressed; for they can
      never be disclosed. Could I have, as my dear father conceived, all the
      time to myself, my friends, my leisure, or my own occupations, that is not
      devoted to my official duties, how different would be my feelings, how far
      more easily accommodated to my privations and sacrifices! Little does the
      queen know the slavery I must either resist or endure. And so frightful is
      hostility, that I know not which part is hardest to perform.

    <h2>
      MADAME DE GENLIs DISCUSSED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Windsor, Monday Evening.</i>&mdash;Madame de la Fite, who calls upon me
      daily, though I am commonly so much engaged I can scarce speak to her for
      a moment, came to desire I would let her bring me M. Argant,<a
      href="#linknote-215" name="linknoteref-215" id="linknoteref-215">[215]</a>
      who was come to Windsor to show some experiment to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Fite has long pressed me with great earnestness to write to
      Madame de Genlis, whose very elegant little note to me I never have
      answered. Alas! what can I do? I think of her as of one of the first among
      women&mdash;I see her full of talents and of charms&mdash;I am willing to
      believe her good, virtuous, and dignified;&mdash;yet, with all this, the
      cry against her is so violent and so universal, and my belief in her
      innocence is wholly unsupported by proof in its favour, or any other
      argument than internal conviction, from what I observed of her conduct and
      manners and conversation when I saw her in London, that I know not how to
      risk a correspondence with her, till better able to satisfy others, as
      well as I am satisfied myself: most especially, I dare not enter into such
      an intercourse through Madame de la Fite, whose indiscreet zeal for us
      both would lead her to tell her successful mediation to everybody she
      could make hear her. Already she has greatly distressed me upon this
      subject. Not content with continual importunity to me to write, ever since
      my arrival, which I have evaded as gently as possible, to avoid giving her
      my humiliating reasons, she has now written Madame de Genlis word that I
      am here, belonging to the same royal household as herself; and then came
      to tell me, that as we were now so closely connected, she proposed our
      writing jointly, in the same letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, with infinite difficulty, I passed over,&mdash;pleading my
      little time; which indeed she sees is true. But when M. Argant was here,
      she said to me, in French, &ldquo;M. Argant will immediately wait upon Madame de
      Genlis, for he is going to Paris; he will tell her he saw us together, and
      he will carry her a letter' from me; and surely Miss Burney will not
      refuse M. Argant the happiness of carrying two lines from one lady so
      celebrated to another?&rdquo; I was quite vexed; a few lines answer the same
      purpose as a few sheets; since, once her correspondent, all that I am
      hesitating about is as completely over, right or wrong, as if I wrote to
      her weekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they left me, I hastened to my dear Mrs. Delany, to consult
      with her what to do. &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;tell the affair of your
      difficulties whether to write to her or not, to the queen: it will
      unavoidably spread, if you enter into such a correspondence, and the
      properest step you can take, the safest and the happiest, is to have her
      opinion, and be guided by it. Madame de Genlis is so public a character,
      you can hardly correspond with her in private, and it would be better the
      queen should hear of such an intercourse from yourself than from any
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I entirely agreed in the wisdom of her advice, though I very much doubted
      my power to exert sufficient courage to speak, unasked, upon any affair of
      my own. You may be sure I resolved to spare poor Madame de la Fite, in my
      application, if I made it: &ldquo;to write, or not to write,&rdquo; was all I wanted
      to determine; for the rest, I must run any risk rather than complain of a
      friend who always means well....
    </p>
    <p>
      An opportunity offered the next morning, for the queen again commanded me
      to follow her into her saloon; and there she was so gentle, and so
      gracious, that I ventured to speak of Madame de Genlis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very fearfully that I took this liberty. I dreaded lest she should
      imagine I meant to put myself under her direction, as if presuming she
      would be pleased to direct me. Something, I told her, I had to say, by the
      advice of Mrs. Delany, which I begged her permission to communicate. She
      assented in silence, but with a look of the utmost softness, and yet mixed
      with strong surprise. I felt my voice faltering, and I was with difficulty
      able to go on,&mdash;so new to me was it to beg to be heard, who,
      hitherto, have always been begged to speak. There is no absolutely
      accounting for the forcible emotions which every totally new situation and
      new effort will excite in a mind enfeebled, like mine, by a long
      succession of struggling agitations. I got behind her chair, that she
      might not see a distress she might wonder at: for it was not this
      application itself that affected me; it was the novelty of my own
      situation, the new power I was calling forth over my proceedings, and the&mdash;O
      my Susan!&mdash;the all that I was changing from&mdash;relinquishing-of
      the past&mdash;and hazarding for the future!
    </p>
    <p>
      With many pauses, and continual hesitation, I then told her that I had
      been earnestly pressed by Madame de Genlis to correspond with her; that I
      admired her with all my heart, and, with all my heart, believed all good
      of her; but that, nevertheless, my personal knowledge of her was too
      slight to make me wish so intimate an intercourse, which I had carefully
      shunned upon all occasions but those where my affection as well as my
      admiration had been interested; though I felt such a request from such a
      woman as Madame de Genlis as an honour, and therefore not to be declined
      without some reason stronger than my own general reluctance to proposals
      of that sort; and I found her unhappily, and I really and sincerely
      believed undeservedly, encircled with such powerful enemies, and accused
      with so much confidence of having voluntarily provoked them, that I could
      not, even in my own mind, settle if it were right to connect myself with
      her so closely, till I could procure information more positive in her
      favour, in order to answer the attacks of those who asperse her,<a
      href="#linknote-216" name="linknoteref-216" id="linknoteref-216">[216]</a>
      and who would highly blame me for entering into a correspondence with a
      character not more unquestionably known to me. I had been desirous to
      wait, suspended, till this fuller knowledge might be brought about; but I
      was now solicited into a decision, by M. Argant, who was immediately going
      to her, and who must either take her a letter from me or show her, by
      taking none, that I was bent upon refusing her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen heard me with the greatest attention, and then said, &ldquo;Have you
      yet writ to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, I said; I had had a little letter from her, but I received it just as
      the Duchess of Portland died, when my whole mind was so much occupied by
      Mrs. Delany, that I could not answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to you then,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;very honestly; if you have not yet
      writ, I think it better you should not write. If you had begun, it would
      be best to go on; but as you have not, it will be the safest way to let it
      alone. You may easily say, without giving her any offence, that you are
      now too much engaged to find time for entering into any new
      correspondence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her for this open advice as well as I was able, and I felt the
      honour its reliance upon my prudence did me, as well as the kindness of
      permitting such an excuse to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen talked on, then, of Madame de Genlis with the utmost frankness;
      she admired her as much as I had done myself, but had been so assaulted
      with tales to her disadvantage, that she thought it unsafe and indiscreet
      to form any connection with her. Against her own judgment, she had herself
      been almost tormented into granting her a private audience, from the
      imprudent vehemence of one of Madame de G.'s friends here, with whom she
      felt herself but little pleased for what she had done, and who, I plainly
      saw, from that unfortunate injudiciousness, would lose all power of
      exerting any influence in future. Having thus unreservedly explained
      herself, she finished the subject, and has never started it since. But she
      looked the whole time with a marked approbation of my applying to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Madame de Genlis! how I grieve at the cloud which hovers over so much
      merit, too bright to be hid but not to be obscured.

    <h2>
      A DISTINGUISHED ASTRONOMER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening Mr. Herschel<a href="#linknote-217" name="linknoteref-217"
       id="linknoteref-217">[217]</a> came to tea. I had once seen that very
      extraordinary man at Mrs. de Luc's, but was happy to see him again, for he
      has not more fame to awaken curiosity, than sense and modesty to gratify
      it. He is perfectly unassuming, yet openly happy; and happy in the success
      of those studies which would render a mind less excellently formed
      presumptuous and arrogant. The king has not a happier subject than this
      man, who owes wholly to his majesty that he is not wretched: for such was
      his eagerness to quit all other pursuits to follow astronomy solely, that
      he was in danger of ruin, when his talents, and great and uncommon genius,
      attracted the king's patronage. He has now not only his pension, which
      gives him the felicity of devoting all his time to his darling study, but
      he is indulged in licence from the king to make a telescope according to
      his new ideas and discoveries, that is to have no cost spared in its
      construction, and is wholly to be paid for by his majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems to have made him happier even than the pension, as it enables
      him to put in execution all his wonderful projects, from which his
      expectations of future discoveries are so sanguine as to make his present
      existence a state of almost perfect enjoyment. Mr. Locke himself would be
      quite charmed with him. He seems a man without a wish that has its object
      in the terrestrial globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, Mr. Herschel, by the king's command, came to exhibit to his
      majesty and the royal family the new comet lately discovered by his
      sister, Miss Herschel; and while I was playing at piquet with Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, the Princess Augusta came into the room, and asked her if
      she chose to go into the garden and look at it. She declined the offer,
      and the princess then made it to me. I was glad to accept it, for all
      sorts of reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found him at his telescope, and I mounted some steps to look through
      it. The comet was very small, and had nothing grand or striking in its
      appearance; but it is the first lady's comet, and I was very desirous to
      see it. Mr. Herschel then showed me some of his new-discovered universes,
      with all the good humour with which he would have taken the same trouble
      for a brother or a sister-astronomer: there is no possibility of admiring
      his genius more than his gentleness.

    <h2>
      EFFUSIVE MADAME DE LA ROCHE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I come now to introduce to you, with a new character, some new
      perplexities from my situation. Madame de la Fite called the next morning,
      to tell me she must take no denial to forming me a new acquaintance&mdash;Madame
      de la Roche, a German by birth, but married to a Frenchman;&mdash;an
      authoress, a woman of talents and distinction, a character highly
      celebrated, and unjustly suffering from an adherence to the Protestant
      religion.<a href="#linknote-218" name="linknoteref-218"
       id="linknoteref-218">[218]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She dies with eagerness to see you,&rdquo; she added, in French, &ldquo;and I have
      invited her to Windsor, where I have told her I have no other feast
      prepared for her but to show her Dr. Herschel and Miss Burney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I leave you to imagine if I felt competent to fulfil such a promise:
      openly, on the contrary, I assured her I was quite unequal to it. She had
      already, she said, written to Madame de la Roche, to come the next day,
      and if I would not meet her she must be covered with disgrace.
      Expostulation was now vain; I could only say that to answer for myself was
      quite, out of my own power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&mdash;and wherefore?&mdash;and what for?&mdash;and surely to me!&mdash;and
      surely for Madame de la Roche!&mdash;une femme d'esprit&mdash;mon amie&mdash;l'amie
      de Madame de Genlis,&rdquo; etc., etc., filled up a hurried conference in the
      midst of my dressing for the queen, till a summons interrupted her, and
      forced me, half dressed, and all too late, to run away from her, with an
      extorted promise to wait upon her if I possibly could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly I went, and arrived before Madame de la Roche. Poor Madame de
      la Fite received me in transport; and I soon witnessed another transport,
      at least equal, to Madame de la Roche, which happily was returned with the
      same warmth; and it was not till after a thousand embraces, and the most
      ardent professions&mdash;&ldquo;Ma digne amie!&mdash;est il possible?&mdash;te
      vois-je?&rdquo; etc.&mdash;that I discovered they had never before met in their
      lives!&mdash;they had corresponded, but, no more!<a href="#linknote-219"
       name="linknoteref-219" id="linknoteref-219">[219]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This somewhat lessened my surprise, however, when my turn arrived; for no
      sooner was I named than all the embrassades were transferred to me&mdash;&ldquo;La
      digne Miss Borni!&mdash;l'auteur de Cecile?&mdash;d'Evelina?&mdash;non, ce
      n'est pas possible!-suis-je si heureuse!&mdash;oui, je le vois a ses yeux!&mdash;Ah!
      que de bonheur!&rdquo; etc....
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Roche, had I met her in any other way, might have pleased me
      in no common degree; for could I have conceived her character to be
      unaffected, her manners have a softness that would render her excessively
      engaging. She is now bien passee&mdash;no doubt fifty&mdash;yet has a
      voice of touching sweetness, eyes of dove-like gentleness, looks
      supplicating for favour, and an air and demeanour the most tenderly
      caressing. I can suppose she has thought herself all her life the model of
      the favourite heroine of her own favourite romance, and I can readily
      believe that she has had attractions in her youth nothing short of
      fascinating. Had I not been present, and so deeply engaged in this
      interview, I had certainly been caught by her myself; for in her presence
      I constantly felt myself forgiving and excusing what in her absence I as
      constantly found past defence or apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Madame de la Fite has no chance in her presence for though their
      singular enthusiasm upon &ldquo;the people of the literature,&rdquo; as Pacchierotti
      called them, is equal, Madame de la Fite almost subdues by her vehemence,
      while Madame de la Roche almost melts by her softness. Yet I fairly
      believe they are both very good women, and both believe themselves
      sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned still time enough to find Mrs. Schwellenberg with her
      tea-party; and she was very desirous to hear something of Madame de la
      Roche. I was led by this to give a short account of her: not such a one as
      you have heard, because I kept it quite independent of all reference to
      poor Madame de la Fite; but there was still enough to make a little
      narration. Madame de la Roche had told me that she had been only three
      days in England, and had yet made but a beginning of seeing les spectacles
      and les gens celebres;&mdash;and what do you think was the first, and, as
      yet, sole spectacle to which she had been carried?&mdash;Bedlam!&mdash;And
      who the first, and, as yet, only homme celebre she had seen&mdash;Lord
      George Gordon!&mdash;whom she called le fameux George Gordon, and with
      whom she had dined, in company with Count Cagliostro.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday, Sept. 17</i>&mdash;At the chapel this morning, Madame de la
      Fite placed Madame de la Roche between herself and me, and proposed
      bringing her to the Lodge, &ldquo;to return my visit.&rdquo; This being precisely what
      I had tried to avoid, and to avoid without shocking Madame de la Fite, by
      meeting her correspondent at her own house, I was much chagrined at such a
      proposal, but had no means to decline it, as it was made across Madame de
      la Roche herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, at about two o'clock, when I came from the queen, I found
      them both in full possession of my room, and Madame de la Fite occupied in
      examining my books. The thing thus being done, and the risk of
      consequences inevitable, I had only to receive them with as little display
      of disapprobation of their measures as I could help; but one of the most
      curious scenes followed I have ever yet been engaged in or witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we were seated, Madame de la Fite began with assuring me,
      aloud, of the &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; I had made of Madaine de la Roche, and appealed
      to that lady for the truth of what she said. Madame de la Roche answered
      her by rising, and throwing her arms about me, and kissing my cheeks from
      side to side repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Fite, as soon as this was over, and we had resumed our seats,
      opened the next subject, by saying Madame de la Roche had read and adored
      &ldquo;Cecilia:&rdquo; again appealing to her for confirmation of her assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, oui, oui!&rdquo; cried her friend, &ldquo;mais la vraie Cecile, est Miss Borni!
      charmante Miss Borni! digne, douce, et aimable&mdash;com to me arms! que
      je vous embrasse millefois!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again we were all deranged, and again the same ceremony being performed,
      we all sat ourselves down. &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; was then talked over throughout, in
      defiance of every obstacle I could put in its way. After this, Madame de
      la Fite said, in French, that Madame de la Roche had had the most
      extraordinary life and adventures that had fallen to anybody's lot; and
      finished with saying, &ldquo;Eh! ma chere amie, contez-nous un peu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were so connected, she answered, in their early part with M. Wieland,
      the famous author, that they would not be intelligible without his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Roche, looking down upon her fan, began then the recital. She
      related their first interview, the gradations of their mutual attachment,
      his extraordinary talents, his literary fame and name; the breach of their
      union from motives of prudence in their friends; his change of character
      from piety to voluptuousness, in consoling himself for her loss with an
      actress; his various adventures, and various transformations from good to
      bad, in life and conduct; her own marriage with M. de la Roche, their
      subsequent meeting when she was mother of three children, and all the
      attendant circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      This narrative was told in so touching and pathetic a manner, and
      interspersed with so many sentiments of tenderness and of heroism, that I
      could scarcely believe I was not actually listening to a Clelia, or a
      Cassandra, recounting the stories of her youth.<a href="#linknote-220"
       name="linknoteref-220" id="linknoteref-220">[220]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had done, and I had thanked her, Madame de la Fite demanded of me
      what I thought of her, and if she was not delightful? I assented, and
      Madame de la Roche then, rising, and fixing her eyes, filled with tears,
      in my face, while she held both my hands, in the most melting accents,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Miss Borni! la plus chere, la plus digne des Angloises!
      dites-moi-m'aimez-vous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered as well as I could, but what I said was not very positive.
      Madame de la Fite came up to us, and desired we might make a trio of
      friendship, which should bind us to one another for life. And then they
      both embraced me, and both wept for joyful fondness! I fear I seemed very
      hard-hearted; but no spring was opened whence one tear of mine could flow.

    <h2>
      A DINNER DIFFICULTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The clock had struck four some time, and Madame de la Fite said she feared
      they kept me from dinner. I knew it must soon be ready, and therefore made
      but a slight negative. She then, with an anxious look at her watch, said
      she feared she was already too late for her own little dinner. I was
      shocked at a hint I had no power to notice, and heard it in silence&mdash;silence
      unrepressing! for she presently added, &ldquo;You dine alone, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-e-s,&mdash;if Mrs. Schwellenberg is not well enough to come down stairs
      to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you dine, ma chere mademoiselle&mdash;can you dine at that great
      table alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must!&mdash;the table is not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in Mrs. Schwellenberg's absence it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has never been made over to me, and I take no power that is not given
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the queen, my dearest ma'am&mdash;the queen, if she knew such a
      person as Madame de la Roche was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and I was quite disconcerted. An attack so explicit, and in
      presence of Madame de la Roche, was beyond all my expectations. She then
      went to the window, and exclaimed, &ldquo;It rains!&mdash;Mon Dieu! que
      ferons-nous?&mdash;My poor littel dinner!&mdash;it will be all spoilt!&mdash;La
      pauvre Madame de la Roche! une telle femme!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was now really distressed, and wished much to invite them both to stay;
      but I was totally helpless; and could only look, as I felt, in the utmost
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain continued. Madame de la Roche could understand but imperfectly
      what passed, and waited its result with an air of smiling patience. I
      endeavoured to talk of other things&mdash;-but Madame de la Fite was
      restless in returning to this charge. She had several times given me very
      open hints of her desire to dine at Mrs. Schwellenberg's table; but I had
      hitherto appeared not to comprehend them: she was now determined to come
      home to the point; and the more I saw her determination, the less liable I
      became to being overpowered by it. At length John came to announce dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Fite looked at me in a most expressive manner, as she rose
      and walked towards the window, exclaiming that the rain would not cease;
      and Madame de la Roche cast upon me a most tender smile, while she
      lamented that some accident must have prevented her carriage from coming
      for her. I felt excessively ashamed, and could only beg them not to be in
      haste, faithfully assuring them I was by no means disposed for eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Madame de la Fite now lost all command of herself, and desiring to
      speak to me in my own room, said, pretty explicitly, that certainly I
      might keep anybody to dinner, at so great a table, and all alone, if I
      wished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to be equally frank. I acknowledged that I had reason to
      believe I might have had that power, from the custom of my predecessor,
      Mrs. Haggerdorn, upon my first succeeding to her; but that I was then too
      uncertain of any of my privileges to assume a single one of them
      unauthorised by the queen. Madame de la Fite was not at all satisfied, and
      significantly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have sometimes Miss Planta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. de Luc, too,&mdash;he may dine with you
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He also comes to Mrs. Schwellenberg. Mrs. Delany alone, and her niece,
      come to me; and they have had the sanction of the queen's own desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mais, enfin, ma chere Miss Burney,&mdash;when it rains,&mdash;and when it
      is so late,&mdash;and when it is for such a woman as Madame de la Roche!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So hard pressed, I was quite shocked to resist her; but I assured her that
      when my own sisters, Phillips and Francis, came to Windsor purposely to
      see me, they had never dined at the Lodge but by the express invitation of
      Mrs. Schwellenberg; and that when my father himself was here, I had not
      ventured to ask him. This, though it surprised, somewhat appeased her; and
      we were called into the other room to Miss Planta, who was to dine with
      me, and who, unluckily, said the dinner would be quite cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They begged us both to go, and leave them till the rain was over, or till
      Madame de la Roche's carriage arrived. I could not bear to do this, but
      entreated Miss Planta, who was in haste, to go and dine by herself. This,
      at last, was agreed to, and I tried once again to enter into discourse
      upon other matters. But how greatly did my disturbance at all this urgency
      increase, when Madame de la Fite said she was so hungry she must beg a bit
      of bread and a glass of water!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now, indeed, upon the point of giving way; but when I considered,
      while I hesitated, what must follow&mdash;my own necessary apology, which
      would involve Madame de la Fite in much blame, or my own concealing
      silence, which would reverse all my plans of openness with the queen, and
      acquiesced with my own situation&mdash;I grew firm again, and having
      assured her a thousand times of my concern for my little power, I went
      into the next room: but I sent her the roll and water by John; I was too
      much ashamed to carry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to them again, Madame de la Fite requested me to go at
      once to the queen, and tell her the case. Ah, poor Madame de la Fite, to
      see so little a way for herself, and to suppose me also so every way
      short-sighted! I informed her that I never entered the presence of the
      queen unsummoned....
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she desired to speak to me in my own room; and then she told me that
      Madame de la Roche had a most earnest wish, to see all the royal family;
      she hoped, therefore, the queen would go to early prayers at the chapel,
      where, at least she might be beheld: but she gave me sundry hints, not to
      be misunderstood, that she thought I might so represent the merits of
      Madame de la Roche as to induce the honour of a private audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could give her no hope of this, as I had none to give for I well knew
      that the queen has a settled aversion to almost all novels, and something
      very near it to almost all novel-writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then told me she had herself requested an interview for her with the
      princess royal, and had told her that if it was too much to grant it in
      the royal apartments, at least it might take place in Miss Burney's room!
      Her royal highness coldly answered that she saw nobody without the queen's
      commands....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, the carriage of Madame de la Roche arrived, about tea-time,
      and Madame de la Fite finished with making me promise to relate my
      difficulties to the queen, that she might give me such orders as to enable
      me to keep them any other time. To give you the result at once, Miss
      Planta, of her own accord, briefly related the affair to the queen,
      dwelling upon my extreme embarrassment, with the most good-natured
      applause of its motives. The queen graciously joined in commendation of my
      steadiness, expressed her disapprobation of the indelicacy of poor Madame
      de la Fite, and added that if I had been overcome, it would have been an
      encouragement to her to bring foreigners for ever to the Lodge, wholly
      contrary to the pleasure of the king.

    <h2>
      AN ECCENTRIC LADY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sept. 25.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Delany came to me to dinner, and we promised
      ourselves the whole afternoon tete-a-tete, with no other interruption than
      what we were well contented to allow to Major Price and General Bude. But
      before we were well settled in my room, after our late dinner in the next,
      a visitor appeared,&mdash;Miss Finch.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were both sadly vexed at this disappointment; but you will wonder to
      hear that I became, in a few minutes, as averse to her going as I had been
      to her coming: for the Princess Amelia was brought in, by Mrs. Cheveley,
      to carry away Mrs. Delany to the queen. I had now, therefore, no one, but
      this chance-comer, to assist me in doing the honours to my two beaus; and
      well as I like their company, I by no means enjoyed the prospect of
      receiving them alone: not, I protest, and am sure, from any prudery, but
      simply from thinking that a single female, in a party, either large or
      small, of men, unless very much used to the world, appears to be in a
      situation awkward and unbecoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was quite concerned, therefore, to hear from Miss Finch that she meant
      but a short visit, for some reasons belonging to her carriage; and when
      she rose to go, I felt my distaste to this new mode of proceeding so
      strong, that I hastily related to her my embarrassment, and frankly begged
      her to stay and help to recreate my guests. She was very much diverted
      with this distress, which she declared she could not comprehend, but
      frankly agreed to remain with me; and promised, at my earnest desire, not
      to publish what I had confessed to her, lest I should gain, around
      Windsor, the character of a prude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had every reason to be glad that I detained her, for she not only made
      my meeting with the equerries easy and pleasant, but was full of odd
      entertainment herself. She has a large portion of whimsical humour, which,
      at times, is original and amusing, though always eccentric, and
      frequently, from uttering whatever comes uppermost, accidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among many other flights, she very solemnly declared that she could never
      keep any body's face in her mind when they were out of her sight. &ldquo;I have
      quite forgot,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;the Duke of York already, though I used to see
      him so continually. Really, it's quite terrible, but I cannot recollect a
      single trait of anybody when they are the shortest time out of my sight;
      especially if they are dead;&mdash;it's quite shocking, but really I can
      never remember the face of a person the least in the world when once they
      are dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major, who knows her very well, and who first had introduced her to me
      on my settling here, was much amused with her rattle; and General Bude is
      always pleased with anything bordering upon the ridiculous. Our evening
      therefore turned out very well.

    <h2>
      THE WRONG GUEST INVITED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have something to relate now that both my dearest friends will take
      great pleasure in hearing, because it appertains to my dignity and
      consequence. The queen, in the most gracious manner, desired me this
      morning to send an invitation to M. Mithoff, a German clergyman, to come
      to dinner; and she added, &ldquo;I assure you he is a very worthy man, of very
      excellent character, or I would not ask you to invite him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was not this a very sweet manner of making over to me the presidency of
      the table in Mrs. Schwellenberg's absence?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for the next day, and I sent John to him immediately; rather
      awkward, though, to send my compliments to a man I had never seen, and
      invite him to dine with me. But there was no other mode&mdash;I could not
      name the queen. I knew Miss Port would be happy to make us a trio, and I
      begged her not to fail me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas!&mdash;If awkwardness was removed, something worse was
      substituted in its place; my presidency was abolished on the very day it
      was to be declared, by the sudden return of its rightful superseder. I
      acquainted her with the invitation I had been desired to send, and I told
      her I had also engaged Miss Port. I told of both as humbly as possible,
      that I might raise no alarms of any intention of rivalry in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mithoff was not yet come when dinner was announced, nor yet Miss Port;
      we sat down tete-a-tete, myself in some pain for my invitations, my
      companion well content to shew she would wait for none of my making.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length came Miss Port, and presently after a tall German clergyman
      entered the room. I was a little confused by his immediately making up to
      me, and thanking me in the strongest terms for the honour of my
      invitation, and assuring me it was the most flattering one he had ever
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered as short as I could, for I was quite confounded by the looks of
      Mrs. Schwellenberg. Towards me they were directed with reproach, and
      towards the poor visitor with astonishment: why I could not imagine, as I
      had frequently heard her speak of M. Mithoff with praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding nothing was said to him, I was obliged to ask him to take a place
      at the table myself, which he did; still, and with great glee of manner,
      addressing himself wholly to me, and never finishing his warm expressions
      of gratitude for my invitation. I quite longed to tell him I had her
      majesty's orders for what I had done, that he might cease his most
      unmerited acknowledgments; but I could not at that time. The dinner went
      off very ill. Nobody said a word but this gentleman, and he spoke only to
      do himself mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we all adjourned to Mrs. Schwellenberg's room upstairs, for coffee,
      my new guest again poured forth such a torrent of thanks, that I could not
      resist taking the first opportunity to inform him he owed me no such
      strong obligation, as I had simply obeyed the commands of the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with yet greater enchantment; &ldquo;then I am very
      happy indeed, madam; I had been afraid at first there was some mistake in
      the honour you did me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have seemed a mistake indeed, sir,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;if you supposed I
      had taken the liberty of making you such an invitation, without the
      pleasure of knowing you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg, just after, calling me aside, said, &ldquo;For what have you
      brought me this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could make no answer, lest he should hear me, for I saw him look
      uneasily towards us; and therefore, to end such interrogations, I turned
      to him, and asked how many days he should continue at Windsor. He looked
      surprised, and said he had no thought of leaving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my turn to look surprised now; I had heard he only came upon her
      majesty's commands, and was to stay but a day or two. I now began to
      suspect some mistake, and that my message had gone to a wrong person. I
      hastened, therefore, to pronounce the name of Mithoff, and my suspicion
      was changed into certainty, by his telling me, with a stare, that it was
      not his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine but my confusion at this information!&mdash;the queen's commission
      so ill executed, M. Mithoff neglected, and some one else invited whose
      very name I knew not!&mdash;nor did he, though my mistake now was visible,
      tell it me. Yet he looked so much disappointed, that I thought it
      incumbent upon me, since the blunder must have been my servant's, to do
      what I could to comfort him. I therefore forced myself forward to talk to
      him, and pass over the embarrassment but he was modest, and consequently
      overset, and soon after took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then cleared myself to Mrs. Schwellenberg of any voluntary deed in
      &ldquo;bringing her this man,&rdquo; and inquired of John how it happened. He told me
      he had forgot the gentleman's name, but as I had said he was a German
      clergyman, he had asked for him as such, and thought this must be the
      right person. I heard afterwards that this is a M. Schrawder, one of the
      masters of the German language to the princesses. I gave all the apologies
      in my power to him for the error....
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, at night, with great good humour, laughed at the mistake, and
      only desired it might be rectified for the next day. Accordingly it was;
      and M. Mithoff had an invitation for the next day, in proper order: that
      is, from Mrs. Schwellenberg.

    <h2>
      THE PRINCESS ROYAL's BIRTHDAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, Sept. 29</i>&mdash;This day the princess royal entered her
      twenty-first year. I had the pleasure of being in the room with the queen
      when she sent for her, early in the morning. Her majesty bid me stop,
      while she went into another apartment to fetch her birthday gifts. The
      charming princess entered with so modest, so composed an air, that it
      seemed as if the day, with all its preparations for splendour, was rather
      solemn than elevating to her. I had no difficulty, thus alone with her, in
      offering my best wishes to her. She received them most gracefully, and
      told me, with the most sensible pleasure, that the King had just been with
      her, and presented to her a magnificent diamond necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen then returned, holding in her hands two very pretty portfolios
      for her drawings, and a very fine gold etui. The princess, in receiving
      them with the lowest curtsey, kissed her hand repeatedly, while the queen
      gave back her kisses upon her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king came in soon after, and the three youngest princesses. They all
      flew to kiss the princess royal, who is affectionately fond of them all.
      Princess Amelia shewed how fine she was, and made the queen admire her new
      coat and frock; she then examined all the new dresses of her sisters, and
      then looking towards me with some surprise, exclaimed, &ldquo;And won't Miss
      Burney be fine, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shall not easily forget this little innocent lesson. It seems all the
      household dress twice on these birthdays&mdash;for their first appearance,
      and for dinner&mdash;and always in something distinguished. I knew it not,
      and had simply prepared for my second attire only, wearing in the morning
      my usual white dimity great coat. I was a little out of countenance; and
      the queen, probably perceiving it, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come hither, Amelia; who do you think is here&mdash;in Miss Burney's
      room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lany,&rdquo; answered the quick little creature; for so she calls Mrs. Delany,
      who had already exerted herself to come to the Lodge with her
      congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, taking the hand of the little princess, said they would go and
      see her; and turning to the queen as they left the room, called out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do with Mrs. Delany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the king pleases,&rdquo; was her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed them to my room, where his majesty stayed some time, giving
      that dear old lady a history of the concert of the preceding evening, and
      that he had ordered for this day for the princess royal. It is rather
      unfortunate her royal highness should have her birth-day celebrated by an
      art which she even professes to have no taste for, and to hear almost with
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king took Mrs. Delany to breakfast with himself and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wore my memorable present-gown this day in honour of the princess royal.
      It is a lilac tabby. I saw the king for a minute at night, as he returned
      from the Castle, and he graciously admired it, calling out &ldquo;Emily should
      see Miss Burney's gown now, and she would think her fine enough.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      ARRIVAL OF A NEW EQUERRY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following evening I first saw the newly-arrived equerry, Colonel
      Goldsworthy. Mrs. Schwellenberg was ill, and sent for Mr. de Luc, and told
      me to go into the eating-room, and make the tea for her. I instantly wrote
      to Miss Port, to beg she would come to assist me: she did, and Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, changing her plan, came downstairs at the same time. The
      party was Major Price, General Bude, Mr. Fisher, and the colonel. Major
      Price immediately presented us to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Schwellenberg, &ldquo;you do the honour here in my
      room!&mdash;you might leave that to me, Major Price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! my brother equerry?&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;No, ma'am, I think I have a right
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Goldsworthy's character stands very high for worth and honour, and
      he is warmly attached to the king, both for his own sake, and from the tie
      that binds him to all the royal family, of regard for a sister extremely
      dear to him, Miss Goldsworthy, whose residence here brings him frequently
      to the palace. He seems to me a man of but little cultivation or
      literature, but delighting in a species of dry humour, in which he shines
      most successfully, in giving up himself for its favourite butt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought me a great many compliments, he said, from Dr. Warton, of
      Winchester, where he had lately been quartered with his regiment. He
      rattled away very amusingly upon the balls and the belles he had seen
      there, laughing at his own gallantry, and pitying and praising himself
      alternately for venturing to exert it.

    <h2>
      CUSTODIAN OF THE QUEEN'S JEWEL Box.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Oct. 2</i>&mdash;The next day we were all to go to Kew: but Mrs.
      Schwellenberg was taken ill, and went by herself to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen sent for me after breakfast, and delivered to me a long box,
      called here the jewel box, in which her jewels are carried to and from
      town that are worn on the Drawing-room days. The great bulk of them remain
      in town all the winter, and remove to Windsor for all the summer, with the
      rest of the family. She told me, as she delivered the key into my hands,
      that as there was always much more room in the box than her travelling
      jewels occupied, I might make what use I pleased of the remaining part;
      adding, with a very expressive smile, &ldquo;I dare say you have books and
      letters that you may be glad to carry backwards and forwards with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I owned that nothing was more true, and thankfully accepted the offer. It
      has proved to me since a comfort of the first magnitude, in conveying all
      my choice papers and letters safely in the carriage with me, as well as
      books in present reading, and numerous odd things....
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Friday, Oct. 6.</i>&mdash;We returned to Windsor without Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, who stayed in town for her physician's advice. The queen
      went immediately to Mrs. Delany, and the princess royal came into my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;for what I am going to say: I hope you will
      excuse my taking such a liberty with you&mdash;but, has nobody told you
      that the queen is always used to have the jewel-box carried into her
      bedroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am, nobody mentioned it to me. I brought it here because I have
      other things in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, when I did not see it in mamma's room,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;that
      nobody had told you of that custom, and so I thought I would come to you
      myself: I hope you will excuse it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may believe how I thanked her, while I promised to take out my own
      goods and chattels, and have it conveyed to its proper place immediately.
      I saw that she imagined the queen might be displeased; and though I could
      never myself imagine that, for an omission of ignorance, I felt the
      benevolence of her intention, and received it with great gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear ma'am,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I am sure I should be most happy to do
      anything for you that should be in my power, always; and really Mrs.
      Schwellenberg ought to have told you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards I happened to be alone with this charming princess, and her
      sister Elizabeth, in the queen's dressing-room. She then came up to me and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now will you excuse me, Miss Burney, if I ask you the truth of something
      I have heard about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's such an odd thing, I don't know how to mention it; but I have wished
      to ask you about it this great while. Pray is it really true that, in your
      illness last year, you coughed so violently that you broke the whalebone
      of your stays in two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As nearly true as possible, ma'am; it actually split with the force of
      the almost convulsive motion of a cough that seemed loud and powerful
      enough for a giant. I could hardly myself believe it was little I that
      made so formidable a noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I could not have given credit to it if I had not heard it from
      yourself! I wanted so much to know the truth, that I determined, at last,
      to take courage and ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried the Princess Elizabeth, &ldquo;had you not a
      blister that gave you great torture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&mdash;in another illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O!&mdash;I know how to pity you!&mdash;I have one on at this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried the princess royal, &ldquo;were not you carried
      out of town, when you were in such a weak condition that you could not
      walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where could your royal highness hear all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were you not almost starved by Sir Richard Jebb?&rdquo; cried Princess
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you not receive great benefit from asses' milk?&rdquo; exclaimed the
      princess royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I begged to know their means of hearing all this; but the queen's
      entrance silenced us all.

    <h2>
      A LAUDATORY ESTIMATE OF THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The queen was unremittingly sweet and gracious, never making me sensible
      of any insufficiency from my single attendance; which, to me, was an
      opportunity the most favourable in the world for becoming more intimately
      acquainted with her mind and understanding. For the excellency of her mind
      I was fully prepared; the testimony of the nation at large could not be
      unfaithful; but the depth and soundness of her understanding surprised me:
      good sense I expected&mdash;to that alone she could owe the even tenor of
      her conduct, universally approved, though examined and judged by the
      watchful eye of multitudes. But I had not imagined that, shut up in the
      confined limits of a Court, she could have acquired any but the most
      superficial knowledge of the world, and the most partial insight into
      character. But I find, now, I have only done justice to her disposition,
      not to her parts, which are truly of that superior order that makes
      sagacity intuitively supply the place of experience. In the course of this
      month I spent much time quite alone with her, and never once quitted her
      presence without fresh admiration of her talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few points I have observed with more pleasure in her than all
      that concerns the office which brings me to her in this private and
      confidential manner. All that breaks from her, in our tete-a-tetes, upon
      the subject of dress, is both edifying and amiable. She equips herself for
      the drawing-room with all the attention in her power; she neglects nothing
      that she thinks becoming to her appearance upon those occasions, and is
      sensibly conscious that her high station makes her attire in public a
      matter of business. As such, she submits to it without murmuring; but a
      yet stronger consciousness of the real futility of such mere outward
      grandeur bursts from her, involuntarily, the moment the sacrifice is paid,
      and she can never refuse herself the satisfaction of expressing her
      contentment to put on a quiet undress. The great coats are so highly in
      her favour, from the quickness with which they enable her to finish her
      toilette, that she sings their praise with fresh warmth every time she is
      allowed to wear them, archly saying to me, with most expressive eyes, &ldquo;If
      I could write&mdash;if I could but write!&mdash;how I would compose upon a
      great coat! I wish I were a poetess, that I might make a song upon it&mdash;I
      do think something very pretty might be said about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These hints she has given me continually; but the Muse was not so kind as
      ever to make me think of the matter again when out of her sight-till, at
      last, she one day, in putting on this favourite dress, half gravely, said,
      &ldquo;I really take it a little ill you won't write something upon these great
      coats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I only laughed, yet, when I left her, I scribbled a few stanzas, copied
      them very fairly, and took them, as soon as they were finished, into her
      room; and there kept them safely in my pocket-book, for I knew not how to
      produce them, and she, by odd accident, forbore from that time to ask for
      them, though her repeated suggestion had, at last, conquered my literary
      indolence.<a href="#linknote-221" name="linknoteref-221"
       id="linknoteref-221">[221]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot here help mentioning a very interesting little scene at which I
      was present, about this time. The queen had nobody but myself with her,
      one morning, when the king hastily entered the room, with some letters in
      his hand, and addressing her in German, which he spoke very fast, and with
      much apparent interest in what he said, he brought the letters up to her,
      and put them into her hand. She received them with much agitation, but
      evidently of a much pleased sort, and endeavoured to kiss his hand as he
      held them. He would not let her, but made an effort, with a countenance of
      the highest satisfaction, to kiss hers. I saw instantly in her eyes a
      forgetfulness, at the moment, that any one was present, while, drawing
      away her hand, she presented him her cheek. He accepted her kindness with
      the same frank affection that she offered it; and the next moment they
      both spoke English, and talked upon common and general subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they said I am far enough from knowing; but the whole was too rapid
      to give me time to quit the room; and I could not but see with pleasure
      that the queen had received some favour with which she was sensibly
      delighted, and that the king, in her acknowledgments, was happily and
      amply paid.

    <h2>
      TABLE DIFFICULTIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No sooner did I find that my coadjutrix ceased to speak of returning to
      Windsor,<a href="#linknote-222" name="linknoteref-222" id="linknoteref-222">[222]</a>
      and that I became, by that means, the presidentess of the dinner and
      tea-table, than I formed a grand design&mdash;no other than to obtain to
      my own use the disposal of my evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of my entrance into this Court, to that of which I am
      writing, I had never been informed that it was incumbent upon me to
      receive the king's equerries at the teatable; yet I observed that they
      always came to Mrs. Schwellenberg, and that she expected them so entirely
      as never to make tea till their arrival. Nevertheless, nothing of that
      sort had ever been intimated to me, and I saw no necessity of falling into
      all her ways, without commands to that purpose: nor could I conclude that
      the king's gentlemen would expect from me either the same confinement, or
      readiness of reception, as had belonged to two invalid old ladies, glad of
      company, and without a single connection to draw them from home....
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not, however, but be struck with a circumstance that shewed me, in
      a rather singular manner, my tea-making seemed at once to be regarded as
      indispensable: this was no other than a constant summons, which John
      regularly brought me every evening, from these gentlemen, to acquaint me
      they were come upstairs to the tea-room, and waiting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined not to notice this: and consequently, the first time Mrs.
      Delany was not well enough to give me her valuable society at the Lodge, I
      went to her house, and spent the evening there; without sending any
      message to the equerries, as any apology must imply a right on their part
      that must involve me in future confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I did three or four times, always with so much success as to gain my
      point for the moment, but never with such happy consequences as to ensure
      it me for the time to come; since every next meeting shewed an air of
      pique, and since every evening had still, unremittingly, the same message
      for John.
    </p>
    <p>
      I concluded this would wear away by use, and therefore resolved to give it
      that chance. One evening, however, when, being quite alone, I was going to
      my loved resource, John, ere I could get out, hurried to me, &ldquo;Ma'am, the
      gentlemen are come up, and they send their compliments, and they wait tea
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; was my answer to this rather cavalier summons, which I did
      not wholly admire; and I put on my hat and cloak, when I was called to the
      queen. She asked me whether I thought Mrs. Delany could come to her, as
      she wished to see her? I offered to go instantly, and inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't tell her I sent you,&rdquo; cried the most considerate queen, &ldquo;lest
      that should make her come when it may hurt her: find out how she is,
      before you mention me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I now knew I must return myself, at any rate, I slipped into the
      tea-room before I set off. I found there Colonel Goldsworthy, looking
      quite glum, General Bude, Mr. Fisher, Mr.&mdash; Fisher, his brother, and
      Mr. Blomberg, chaplain to the Prince of Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I opened the door, General Bude presented Mr. Blomberg to me,
      and Mr. Fisher his brother; I told them, hastily, that I was running away
      to Mrs. Delany, but meant to return in a quarter of an hour, when I should
      be happy to have their company, if they could wait so long; but if they
      were hurried, my man should bring their tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all turned to Colonel Goldsworthy, who, as equerry in waiting, was
      considered as head of the party; but he seemed so choked with surprise and
      displeasure, that he could only mutter something too indistinct to be
      heard, and bowed low and distantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Colonel Goldsworthy can command his time, ma'am,&rdquo; cried Mr. Fisher,
      &ldquo;we shall be most happy to wait yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Bude said the same: the colonel again silently and solemnly bowed,
      and I curtsied in the same manner, and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany was not well; and I would not vex her with the queen's kind
      wish for her. I returned, and sent in, by the page in waiting, my account:
      for the queen was in the concert-room, and I could not go to her. Neither
      would I seduce away Miss Port from her duty; I came back, therefore,
      alone, and was fain to make my part as good as I was able among my beaus.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found them all waiting. Colonel Goldsworthy received me with the same
      stately bow, and a look so glum and disconcerted, that I instantly turned
      from him to meet the soft countenance of the good Mr. Fisher, who took a
      chair next mine, and entered into conversation with his usual intelligence
      and mildness. General Bude was chatty and well bred, and the two strangers
      wholly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not, however, but see that Colonel Goldsworthy grew less and less
      pleased. Yet what had I done?&mdash;I had never been commanded to devote
      my evenings to him, and, if excused officially, surely there could be no
      private claim from either his situation or mine. His displeasure therefore
      appeared to me so unjust, that I resolved to take not the smallest notice
      of it. He never once opened his mouth, neither to me nor to any one else.
      In this strange manner we drank our tea. When it was over, he still sat
      dumb&mdash;and still I conversed with Mr. Fisher and General Bude.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a prodigious hemming showed a preparation in the colonel for a
      speech: it came forth with great difficulty, and most considerable
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, ma'am,&mdash;I am afraid you&mdash;you&mdash;that is&mdash;that
      we are intruders upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-o,&rdquo; answered I, faintly, &ldquo;why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, ma'am, if we are&mdash;if you think&mdash;if we take too much
      liberty&mdash;I am sure I would not for the world!&mdash;I only&mdash;your
      commands&mdash;nothing else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried I, not understanding a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, ma'am, we only intrude upon you: however, you must excuse my just
      saying we would not for the world have taken such a liberty, though very
      sensible of the happiness of being allowed to come in for half an hour,&mdash;which
      is the best half-hour of the whole day; but yet, if it was not for your
      own commands&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What commands, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grew still more perplexed, and made at least a dozen speeches to the
      same no purpose, before I could draw from him anything explicit; all of
      them listening silently the whole time, and myself invariably staring. At
      last, a few words escaped him more intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your messages, ma'am, were what encouraged us to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, sir, do tell me what messages?&mdash;I am very happy to see
      you, but I never sent any messages at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, ma'am!&rdquo; cried he, staring in his turn; &ldquo;why your servant, little
      John there, came rapping at our door, at the equerry room, before we had
      well swallowed our dinner, and said, 'My lady is waiting tea, sir.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was quite confounded. I assured him it was an entire fabrication of my
      servant's, as I had never sent, nor even thought of sending him, for I was
      going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why to own the truth, ma'am,&rdquo; cried he, brightening up, &ldquo;I did really
      think it a little odd to send for us in that hurry, for we got up directly
      from table, and said, if the lady is waiting, to be sure we must not keep
      her; and then&mdash;when we came&mdash;to just peep in, and say you were
      going out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How intolerable an impertinence in John!&mdash;it was really no wonder the
      poor colonel was so glum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I repeated my ignorance of this step; and he then said &ldquo;Why, ma'am,
      he comes to us regularly every afternoon, and says his lady is waiting;
      and we are very glad to come, poor souls that we are, with no rest all the
      livelong day but what we get in this good room!&mdash;but then&mdash;to
      come, and see ourselves only intruders&mdash;and to find you going out,
      after sending for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could scarce find words to express my amazement at this communication. I
      cleared myself instantly from having any the smallest knowledge of John's
      proceedings, and Colonel Goldsworthy soon recovered all his spirits and
      good humour, when he was satisfied he had not designedly been treated with
      such strange and unmeaning inconsistency. He rejoiced exceedingly that he
      had spoke out, and I thanked him for his frankness, and the evening
      concluded very amicably....
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening after, I invited Miss Port, determined to spend it entirely
      with my beaus, in order to wholly explain away this impertinence. Colonel
      Goldsworthy now made me a thousand apologies for having named the matter
      to me at all. I assured him I was extremely glad he had afforded me an
      opportunity of clearing it. In the course of the discussion, I mentioned
      the constant summons brought me by John every afternoon. He lifted up his
      hands and eyes, and protested most solemnly he had never sent a single
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vow, ma'am,&rdquo; cried the colonel, &ldquo;I would not have taken such a liberty
      on any account; though all the comfort of my life in this house, is one
      half-hour in a day spent in this room. After all one's labours, riding,
      and walking, and standing, and bowing&mdash;what a life it is! Well! it's
      honour! that's one comfort; it's all honour! royal honour!&mdash;one has
      the honour to stand till one has not a foot left; and to ride till one's
      stiff, and to walk till one's ready to drop,&mdash;and then one makes
      one's lowest bow, d'ye see, and blesses one's self with joy for the
      honour!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      AN EQUERRY'S DUTIES AND DISCOMFORTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      His account of his own hardships and sufferings here, in the discharge of
      his duty, is truly comic. &ldquo;How do you like it, ma'am?&rdquo; he says to me,
      &ldquo;though it's hardly fair to ask you yet, because you know almost nothing
      of the joys of this sort of life. But wait till November and December, and
      then you'll get a pretty taste of them! Running along in these cold
      passages, then bursting into rooms fit to bake you, then back again into
      all these agreeable puffs!&mdash;Bless us! I believe in my heart there's
      wind enough in these passages to carry a man of war! And there you'll have
      your share, ma'am, I promise you that! you'll get knocked up in three
      days, take my word for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I begged him not to prognosticate so much evil for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ma'am, there's no help for it!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;you won't have the hunting,
      to be sure, nor amusing yourself with wading a foot and a-half through the
      dirt, by way of a little pleasant walk, as we poor equerries do! It's a
      wonder to me we outlive the first month. But the agreeable puffs of the
      passages you will have just as completely as any of us. Let's see, how
      many blasts must you have every time you go to the queen? First, one upon
      your opening your door; then another, as you get down the three steps from
      it, which are exposed to the wind from the garden door downstairs; then a
      third, as you turn the corner to enter the passage; then you come plump
      upon another from the hall door; then comes another, fit to knock you
      down, as you turn to the upper passage; then, just as you turn towards the
      queen's room, comes another; and last, a whiff from the king's stairs,
      enough to blow you half a mile off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere healthy breezes,&rdquo; I cried, and assured him I did not fear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay till Christmas,&rdquo; cried he, with a threatening air, &ldquo;only stay till
      then, and let's see what you'll say to them; you'll be laid up as sure as
      fate! you may take my word for that. One thing, however, pray let me
      caution you about&mdash;don't go to early prayers in November; if you do,
      that will completely kill you! Oh, ma'am, you know nothing yet of all
      these matters! only pray, joking apart, let me have the honour just to
      advise you this one thing, or else it's all over with you, I do assure
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain I begged him to be more merciful in his prophecies; he
      failed not, every night, to administer to me the same pleasant
      anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the princesses,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;used to it as they are, get regularly
      knocked up before this business is over; off they drop, one by one:&mdash;first
      the queen deserts us; then Princess Elizabeth is done for; then princess
      royal begins coughing; then Princess Augusta gets the snuffles; and all
      the poor attendants, my poor sister at their head, drop off, one after
      another, like so many snuffs of candles: till at last, dwindle, dwindle,
      dwindle&mdash;not a soul goes to the chapel but the king, the parson, and
      myself; and there we three freeze it out together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when he had been out very late hunting with the king, he
      assumed so doleful an air of weariness, that had not Miss Port exerted her
      utmost powers to revive him, he would not have uttered a word the whole
      night; but when once brought forward, he gave us more entertainment than
      ever, by relating his hardships.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all the labours,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;of the chase, all the riding, the
      trotting, the galloping, the leaping, the&mdash;with your favour, ladies,
      I beg pardon, I was going to say a strange word, but the&mdash;the
      perspiration&mdash;and&mdash;and all that&mdash;after being wet through
      over head, and soused through under feet, and popped into ditches, and
      jerked over gates, what lives we do lead! Well, it's all honour! that's my
      only comfort! Well, after all this, fagging away like mad from eight in
      the morning to five or six in the afternoon, home we come, looking like so
      many drowned rats, with not a dry thread about us, nor a morsel within us&mdash;sore
      to the very bone, and forced to smile all the time! and then after all
      this what do you think follows?&mdash;'Here, Goldsworthy,' cries his
      majesty: so up I comes to him, bowing profoundly, and my hair dripping
      down to my shoes; 'Goldsworthy,' cries his majesty. 'Sir,' says I, smiling
      agreeably, with the rheumatism just creeping all over me! but still,
      expecting something a little comfortable, I wait patiently to know his
      gracious pleasure, and then, 'Here, Goldsworthy, say!' he cries, 'will you
      have a little barley water?' Barley water in such a plight as that! Fine
      compensation for a wet jacket, truly!&mdash;barley water! I never heard of
      such a thing in my life! barley water after a whole day's hard hunting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray did you drink it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drink it?&mdash;Drink barley water? no, no; not come to that neither.
      But there it was, sure enough!&mdash;in a jug fit for a sick room, just
      such a thing as you put upon a hob in a chimney, for some poor miserable
      soul that keeps his bed! just such a thing as that!&mdash;And, 'Here,
      Goldsworthy,' says his majesty, 'here's the barley water.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did the king drink it himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, God bless his majesty! but I was too humble a subject to do the same
      as the king!&mdash;Barley water, quoth I!&mdash;Ha! ha!&mdash;a fine treat
      truly! Heaven defend me! I'm not come to that, neither!&mdash;bad enough
      too, but not so bad as that.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      ROYAL CAUTIONS AND CONFIDENCES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Nov. 1.</i>&mdash;We began this month by steadily settling ourselves at
      Kew. A very pleasant circumstance happened to me on this day, in venturing
      to present the petition of an unfortunate man who had been shipwrecked;
      whose petition was graciously attended to, and the money he solicited was
      granted him. I had taken a great interest in the poor man, from the
      simplicity and distress of his narration, and took him into one of the
      parlours to assist him in drawing up his memorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, when, with equal sweetness and humanity, she had delivered the
      sum to one of her pages to give to him, said to me, &ldquo;Now, though your
      account of this poor man makes him seem to be a real object, I must give
      you one caution: there are so many impostors about, who will try to speak
      to you, that, if you are not upon your guard, you may be robbed yourself
      before you can get any help: I think, therefore, you had better never
      trust yourself in a room alone with anybody you don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her for her gracious counsel, and promised, for the future, to
      have my man always at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was afterwards much touched with a sort of unconscious confidence with
      which she relieved her mind. She asked me my opinion of a paper in the
      &ldquo;Tatler,&rdquo; which I did not recollect; and when she was dressed, and seated
      in her sitting-room, she made me give her the book, and read to me this
      paper. It is an account of a young man of a good heart and sweet
      disposition, who is allured by pleasure into a libertine life, which he
      pursues by habit, but with constant remorse, and ceaseless shame and
      unhappiness. It was impossible for me to miss her object: all the mother
      was in her voice while she read it, and her glistening eyes told the
      application made throughout.<a href="#linknote-223" name="linknoteref-223"
       id="linknoteref-223">[223]</a> My mind sympathised sincerely, though my
      tongue did not dare allude to her feelings. She looked pensively down when
      she had finished it, and before she broke silence, a page came to announce
      the Duchess of Ancaster.

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN TIRED OF HER GEWGAWS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Nov. 3.</i>&mdash;In the morning I had the honour of a conversation
      with the queen, the most delightful, on her part, I had ever yet been
      indulged with. It was all upon dress, and she said so nearly what I had
      just imputed to her in my little stanzas, that I could scarce refrain
      producing them; yet could not muster courage. She told me, with the
      sweetest grace imaginable, how well she had liked at first her jewels and
      ornaments as queen,&mdash;&ldquo;But how soon,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;was that over!
      Believe me, Miss Burney, it is a pleasure of a week,&mdash;a fortnight, at
      most,&mdash;and to return no more! I thought, at first, I should always
      choose to wear them, but the fatigue, and trouble of putting them on, and
      the care they required, and the fear of losing them,&mdash;believe me,
      ma'am, in a fortnight's time I longed again for my own earlier dress, and
      wished never to see them more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then still more opened her opinions and feelings. She told me she had
      never, in her most juvenile years, loved dress and shew, nor received the
      smallest pleasure from any thing in her external appearance beyond
      neatness and comfort: yet did not disavow that the first week or fortnight
      of being a queen, when only in her seventeenth year, she thought splendour
      sufficiently becoming her station to believe she should thenceforth choose
      constantly to support it. But her eyes alone were dazzled, not her mind;
      and therefore the delusion speedily vanished, and her understanding was
      too strong to give it any chance of returning,

    <h2>
      A HOLIDAY AT LAST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Nov 4.</i>&mdash;This morning, when I attended the queen, she asked me
      if I should like to go and see my father at Chesington? and then gave
      orders immediately for a chaise to be ready without delay&mdash;&ldquo;And there
      is no need you should hurry yourself,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;for it will do
      perfectly well if you are back to dinner; when I dress, I will send for
      Miss Planta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her very much, and she seemed quite delighted to give me this
      gratification. &ldquo;The first thing I thought of this morning, when I woke,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;and when I saw the sun shining in upon the bed, was that this
      would be a fine morning for Miss Burney to go and see her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And soon after, to make me yet more comfortable she found a deputy for my
      man as well as for myself, condescending to give orders herself that
      another person might lay the cloth, lest I should be hurried home on that
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not tell my two dear readers how sensibly I felt her goodness, when
      I acquaint them of its effect upon me; which was no less than to induce,
      to impel me to trust her with my performance of her request. just as she
      was quitting her dressing-room, I got behind her, and suddenly blurted out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty's goodness to me, ma'am, makes me venture to own that there
      is a command which I received some time ago, and which I have made some
      attempt to execute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round with great quickness,&mdash;&ldquo;The great coat?&rdquo; she cried,
      &ldquo;is it that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to be so soon understood, and took it from my pocket book&mdash;but
      holding it a little back, as she offered to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your majesty alone,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;I must entreat that it may meet no
      other eyes, and I hope it will not be looked at when any one else is even
      in sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a ready promise, and took it with an alacrity and walked off
      with a vivacity that assured me she would not be very long before she
      examined it; though, when I added another little request, almost a
      condition, that it might not be read till I was far away, she put it into
      her pocket unopened, and, wishing me a pleasant ride, and that I might
      find my father well, she proceeded towards the breakfast parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear friends will, I know, wish to see it,&mdash;and so they shall;
      though not this moment, as I have it not about me, and do not remember it
      completely.<a href="#linknote-224" name="linknoteref-224"
       id="linknoteref-224">[224]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      My breakfast was short, the chaise was soon ready, and forth I sallied for
      dear&mdash;once how dear!&mdash;old Chesington! Every step of the road
      brought back to my mind the first and most loved and honoured friend of my
      earliest years, and I felt a melancholy almost like my first regret for
      him, when I considered what joy, what happiness I lost, in missing his
      congratulations on a situation so much what he would have chosen for me&mdash;congratulations
      which, flowing from a mind such as his, so wise, so zealous, so sincere,
      might almost have reconciled me to it myself&mdash;I mean even then&mdash;for
      now the struggle is over, and I am content enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      John rode on, to open the gates; the gardener met him and I believe
      surprise was never greater than he carried into the house with my name.
      Out ran dear Kitty Cooke, whose honestly affectionate reception touched me
      very much,&mdash;&ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;had our best friend lived to see this
      day when you came to poor old Chesington from Court!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grief, ever fresh, then overflowed in a torrent and I could hardly
      either comfort her, or keep down the sad regretful recollections rising in
      my own memory. O my dear Susan, with what unmixed satisfaction, till that
      fatal period when I paid him my last visit, had I ever entered those
      gates-where passed the scenes of the greatest ease, gaiety, and native
      mirth that have fallen to my lot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. James Burney next, all astonishment, and our dear James himself, all
      incredulity, at the report carried before me, came out.<a
      href="#linknote-225" name="linknoteref-225" id="linknoteref-225">[225]</a>
      Their hearty welcome and more pleasant surprise recovered me from the
      species of consternation with which I had approached their dwelling, and
      the visit, from that time, turned out perfectly gay and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest father was already gone to town; but I had had much reason to
      expect I should miss him, and therefore I could not be surprised....
    </p>
    <p>
      I left them all with great reluctance: I had no time to walk in the
      garden,&mdash;no heart to ascend the little mount, and see how Norbury
      hills and woods looked from it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I set out a little the sooner, to enable me to make another visit, which I
      had also much at heart,&mdash;it was to our aunts at Kingston. I can never
      tell you their astonishment at sight of me; they took me for my own ghost,
      I believe, at first, but they soon put my substance to the proof, and
      nothing could better answer my motives than my welcome, which I need not
      paint to my Susan, who never sees them without experiencing it. To my
      great satisfaction, also, my nieces Fanny and Sophy happened to be there
      at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      My return was just in time for my company, which I found increased by the
      arrival of two more gentlemen, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Turbulent. Mr. Fisher
      had been ordered to come, that he might read prayers the next day, Sunday.
      Mr. Turbulent<a href="#linknote-226" name="linknoteref-226"
       id="linknoteref-226">[226]</a> was summoned, I suppose, for his usual
      occupations; reading with the princesses, or to the queen. Shall I
      introduce to you this gentleman such as I now think him at once? or wait
      to let his character open itself to you by degrees, and in the same manner
      that it did to me? So capital a part as you will find him destined to
      play, hereafter, in my concerns, I mean, sooner or later, to the best of
      my power, to make you fully acquainted with him....
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his seat next mine at the table, and assisted me, while Mr. Fisher
      sat as chaplain at the bottom. The dinner went off extremely well, though
      from no help of mine.... The three men and the three females were all
      intimately acquainted with one another, and the conversation, altogether,
      was equal, open, and agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may a little judge of this, when I tell you a short speech that
      escaped Miss Planta. Mr. Turbulent said he must go early to town the next
      morning, and added, he should call to see Mrs. Schwellenberg, by order of
      the queen, &ldquo;Now for heaven's sake, Mr. Turbulent,&rdquo; she cried, eagerly,
      &ldquo;don't you begin talking to her of how comfortable we are here!&mdash;it
      will bring her back directly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said in a half whisper; and I hope no one else heard it. I leave
      you, my dear friends, to your own comments.

    <h2>
      TEA ROOM GAMBOLS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Smelt and Mrs. Delany came to us at teatime. Then, and in
      their society, I grew more easy and disengaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet little Princess Amelia, who had promised me a visit, came during
      tea, brought by Mrs. Cheveley. I left every body to play with her, and Mr.
      Smelt joined in our gambols. We pretended to put her in a phaeton, and to
      drive about and make visits with her. She entered into the scheme with
      great spirit and delight, and we waited upon Mrs. Delany and Mrs. Smelt
      alternately. Children are never tired of playing at being women; and women
      there are who are never tired, in return, of playing at being children!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this frolicking, which at times was rather noisy, by Mr.
      Smelt's choosing to represent a restive horse, the king entered! We all
      stopped short, guests, hosts, and horses; and all, with equal celerity,
      retreated, making the usual circle for his majesty to move in. The little
      princess bore this interruption to her sport only while surprised into
      quiet by the general respect inspired by the king. The instant that wore
      off, she grew extremely impatient for the renewal of our gambols, and
      distressed me most ridiculously by her innocent appeals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney!&mdash;come!&mdash;why don't you play?&mdash;Come, Miss
      Burney, I say, play with me!&mdash;come into the phaeton again!&mdash;why
      don't you, Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a thousand vain efforts to quiet her by signs, I was forced to
      whisper her that I really could play no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? why, Miss Burney?&mdash;do! do come and play with me!&mdash;You
      must, Miss Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This petition growing still more and more urgent, I was obliged to declare
      my reason, in hopes of appeasing her, as she kept pulling me by the hand
      and gown, so entirely with all her little strength, that I had the
      greatest difficulty to save myself from being suddenly jerked into the
      middle of the room: at length, therefore, I whispered, &ldquo;We shall disturb
      the king, ma'am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was enough; she flew instantly to his majesty, who was in earnest
      discourse with Mr. Smelt, and called out, &ldquo;Papa, go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go! papa,&mdash;you must go!&rdquo; repeated she eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king took her up in his arms, and began kissing and playing with her;
      she strove with all her might to disengage herself, calling aloud &ldquo;Miss
      Burney! Miss Burney! take me&mdash;come, I say, Miss Burney!&mdash;O Miss
      Burney, come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine what a general smile went round the room at this appeal:
      the king took not any notice of it, but set her down, and went on with his
      discourse. She was not, however, a moment quiet till he retired: and then
      we renewed our diversions, which lasted to her bed-time.

    <h2>
      A DREADFUL MISHAP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Nov. 6.</i>&mdash;This morning happened my first disgrace of being too
      late for the queen&mdash;this noon, rather; for in a morning 'tis a
      disaster that has never arrived to this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair thus came to pass. I walked for some time early in Kew gardens,
      and then called upon Mrs. Smelt. I there heard that the king and queen
      were gone, privately, to Windsor, to the Lodge&mdash;probably for some
      papers they could not intrust with a messenger. Mr. Smelt, therefore,
      proposed taking this opportunity of shewing me Richmond gardens, offering
      to be my security that I should have full time. I accepted the proposal
      with pleasure, and we set out upon our expedition. Our talk was almost all
      of the queen. Mr. Smelt wishes me to draw up her character. I owned to him
      that should it appear to me, on nearer and closer inspection, what it
      seemed to me then, the task could not be an unpleasant one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw me safe to the Lodge, and there took his leave: and I was going
      leisurely upstairs, when I met the Princess Amelia and Mrs. Cheveley; and
      while I was playing with the little princess, Mrs. Cheveley announced to
      me that the queen had been returned some time, and that I had been sent
      for immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thunderstruck at this intelligence, I hastened to her dressing-room; when
      I opened the door, I saw she was having her hair dressed. To add to my
      confusion, the Princess Augusta, Lady Effingham, and Lady Frances Howard
      were all in the room. I stood still at the door, not knowing whether to
      advance, or wait a new summons. In what a new situation did I feel myself!&mdash;and
      how did I long to give way to my first impulse, and run back to my own
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute or two, the queen not a little drily said, &ldquo;Where have you
      been, Miss Burney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her my tale,&mdash;that hearing she was gone to Windsor, I had been
      walking in Richmond gardens with Mr. Smelt. She said no more, and I stood
      behind her chair. The princess and two ladies were seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      What republican feelings were rising in my breast, till she softened them
      down again, when presently, in a voice changed from that dryness which had
      wholly disconcerted me, to its natural tone, she condescended to ask me to
      look at Lady Frances Howard's gown, and see if it was not very pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made a dutiful subject of me again in a moment. Yet I felt a
      discomposure all day, that determined me upon using the severest caution
      to avoid such a surprise for the future. The Windsor journey having been
      merely upon business, had been more brief than was believed possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I left the queen, I was told that Mrs. Delany was waiting for me in
      the parlour. What a pleasure and relief to me to run to that dear lady,
      and relate to her my mischance, and its circumstances! Mr. Smelt soon
      joined us there; he was shocked at the accident; and I saw strongly by his
      manner how much more seriously such a matter was regarded, than any one,
      unused to the inside of a Court, could possibly imagine.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;IS IT PERMITTED?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Nov. 8.</i>&mdash;This was the birth-day of the Princess Augusta, now
      eighteen. I could not resist this opportunity of presenting her one of my
      fairings, though I had some little fear she might think herself past the
      age for receiving birth-day gifts, except from the royal family: however
      they had arrived so seemingly a propos, and had been so much approved by
      the queen, that I determined to make the attempt. I took one of the
      work-boxes, and wrote with a pencil, round the middle ornament, &ldquo;Est-il
      permis?&rdquo;&mdash;and then I sent for Miss Makentomb, the princess's wardrobe
      woman, and begged her to place the box upon her royal highness's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the queen's dressing-time, as I opened the door, her majesty said, &ldquo;O,
      here she is!&mdash;Est-il permis?&mdash;Come, come in to Augusta!&rdquo; and
      made me follow her into the next room, the door of which was open, where
      the princess was seated at a writing-desk, probably answering some
      congratulatory letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, in a manner the most pleasing, she thanked me for the little
      cadeau, saying, &ldquo;Only one thing I must beg, that you will write the motto
      with a pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen seconded this motion, smilingly repeating &ldquo;Est-il permis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And afterwards, in the evening, the Princess Augusta came to the parlour,
      to fetch Mrs. Delany and Mrs. Smelt, and again said, &ldquo;Now, will you, Miss
      Burney&mdash;will you write that for me with a pen?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE PLUMP PROVOST AND HIS LADY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Nov. 23.</i>-In the evening I had a large party of new acquaintance;
      the provost of Eton, Dr. Roberts, his lady, Mr. Dewes, Miss Port, the Duke
      of Montagu, General Bude, Colonel Goldsworthy, and Madame de la Fite. The
      party had the royal sanction, I need not tell you. The king and queen are
      always well disposed to shew civility to the people of Eton and Windsor,
      and were therefore even pleased at the visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost is very fat, with a large paunch and gouty legs. He is
      good-humoured, loquacious, gay, civil, and parading. I am told,
      nevertheless, he is a poet, and a very good one. This, indeed, appears
      not, neither in a person such as I have described, nor in manners such as
      have drawn from me the character just given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts is a fine woman, though no longer very young; she is his
      second wife, and very kind to all his family. She seems good-natured and
      sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening turned out very well: they were so delighted with making a
      visit under the royal roof, that everything that passed pleased them: and
      the sight of that disposition helped me to a little more spirit than usual
      in receiving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king came into the room to fetch Mrs. Delany, and looked much
      disappointed at missing her; nevertheless, he came forward, and entered
      into conversation with the provost, upon Eton, the present state of the
      school, and all that belongs to its establishment. His majesty takes a
      great interest in the welfare and prosperity of that seminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost was enchanted by this opportunity of a long and private
      conference, and his lady was in raptures in witnessing it. She concluded,
      from that time, that the door would never open, but for the entrance of
      some of the royal family; and when the equerries came, she whispered me,
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; And again, on the appearance of a star on the Duke of
      Montagu., she said, &ldquo;Who can that be, Miss Burney?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE EQUERRIES VIOLATE THE RULES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Dec. 10.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Delany, upon her recovery,<a
      href="#linknote-227" name="linknoteref-227" id="linknoteref-227">[227]</a>
      had invited the general and colonel to come to tea any evening. For them
      to be absent from the Lodge was contrary to all known rules; but the
      colonel vowed he would let the matter be tried, and take its course. Mrs.
      Delany hoped by this means to bring the colonel into better humour with my
      desertion of the teatable, and to reconcile him to an innovation of which
      he then must become a partaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day when this grand experiment was to be made, that we might not
      seem all to have eloped clandestinely, in case of inquiry, I previously
      made known to the queen my own intention, and had her permission for my
      visit. But the gentlemen, determining to build upon the chance of
      returning before they were missed, gave no notice of their scheme, but
      followed me to Mrs. Delany's as soon as they quitted their own table. I
      had sent to speak with General Bude in the morning, and then arranged the
      party: he proposed that the colonel and himself should esquire me, but I
      did not dare march forth in such bold defiance; I told him, therefore, I
      must go in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delany received us with her usual sweetness. We then began amusing
      ourselves with surmises of the manner in which we should all be missed, if
      our rooms were visited in our absence; and the colonel, in particular,
      drew several scenes, highly diverting, of what he supposed would pass,&mdash;of
      the king's surprise and incredulity, of the hunting up and down of the
      house in search of him, and of the orders issued throughout the house to
      examine to what bed-post he had hanged himself,&mdash;for nothing less
      than such an act of desperation could give courage to an equerry to be
      absent without leave!
    </p>
    <p>
      Further conjectures were still starting, and all were engaged in aiding
      them and enjoying them, when suddenly a violent knocking at the door was
      followed by the most unexpected entrance of the Queen and the Princess
      Amelia!
    </p>
    <p>
      Universal was the start, and most instantaneous and solemn the silence! I
      felt almost guilty, though not for myself: my own invariable method of
      avowing all my proceedings saved me from the smallest embarrassment on my
      own account in this meeting; but I was ashamed to appear the leader in a
      walk so new as that of leaving the Lodge in an evening, and to have
      induced any others to follow my example. The queen looked extremely
      surprised, but not at me, whom she knew she should encounter; and the two
      gentlemen hardly could settle whether to make humble explanations, or
      frank ridicule, of the situation in which they were caught. The queen,
      however, immediately put them at their ease, speaking to them with marked
      civility, and evidently desirous not to mar what she found intended as a
      private frolic, by any fears of her disapprobation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not stay long, and they soon followed her to the Lodge. I also
      returned, and at night the queen owned to me, but very good-humouredly,
      that she had never been more astonished than at sight of the equerries
      that evening, and asked me how it came to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Delany, ma'am,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;as she had taken away their tea-maker,
      thought she could do no less than offer them tea for once at her own
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here the matter rested. But the enterprise has never been repeated.

    <h2>
      MR. TURBULENT ON COURT ROUTINE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Dec. 13.</i>&mdash;Our dinner was as usual, the Smelts, Messrs. de Luc
      and Turbulent, and Miss Planta; and the last only was gone when Mr. and
      Mrs. Hayes arrived. Mrs. Hayes is a really pretty as well as a pretty sort
      of woman,<a href="#linknote-228" name="linknoteref-228"
       id="linknoteref-228">[228]</a> and modest, well-bred, and sensible&mdash;and
      the afternoon, with the assistance of Mr. Smelt, did very well. They went
      early home, and both the Smelts were called to the queen's rooms; M. de
      Luc said he must retire to write down &ldquo;some thoughts upon an experiment in
      his head,&rdquo; and only Mr. Turbulent remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the partner of my confinement a man of uncommon capacity, but
      something there was hung about him, or hung about me, that prevented my
      assimilating-with him in anything. I saw he was endowed with great powers
      of agreeability; but I thought him obtrusive; and that alone is a drawback
      to all merit, that I know not how to pass over. He spoke his opinions with
      great openness, equally upon people and things; but it seemed rather from
      carelessness than confidence, and I 'know him too little to feel obliged
      in his trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk was chiefly upon mere general subjects, till by 'some accident
      the approaching birth-day of the queen was mentioned. He then inquired of
      me how I should like the state business of that day?
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him I knew nothing of what I had to expect from it. He undertook
      readily to inform me. He said I was to be sumptuously arrayed, to sit in
      one of the best rooms at St. James's, and there to receive all the ladies
      of the queen in particular, and to do the honours to all the gentlemen
      also, belonging to the establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and told him he had painted to me a scene of happiness
      peculiarly adapted to my taste!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not concern himself to examine whether or not I was serious, but
      said he supposed, of course, the dignity of such a matter of state could
      not be disagreeable to me, and added, he should take the liberty to wish
      me joy of the day, among the rest, when it arrived, and to see me in my
      glory. After this he said, &ldquo;You have now nearly seen the whole of
      everything that will come before you: in a very short time you will have
      passed six months here, and then you will know your life for as many, and
      twice and thrice as many years. You will have seen everybody and

      AN EQUERRY ON THE COURT CONCERT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Dec. 26</i>&mdash;Colonel Goldsworthy ran on, till General Bude
      reminded him it was time they should appear in the concert-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried he, reluctantly, &ldquo;now for the fiddlers! There I go, plant
      myself against the side of the chimney, stand first on one foot, then on
      the other, hear over and over again all that fine squeaking, and then fall
      fast asleep, and escape by mere miracle from flouncing down plump in all
      their faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would the queen say if you did that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ma'am, the queen would know nothing of the matter; she'd only suppose
      it some old double bass that tumbled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, could not she see what it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no! ma'am, we are never in the room with the queen! that's the
      drawing-room, beyond, where the queen sits; we go no farther than the
      fiddling-room. As to the queen, we don't see her week after week
      sometimes. The king, indeed, comes there to us, between whiles, though
      that's all as it happens, now Price is gone. He used to play at backgammon
      with Price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you do there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I tell you&mdash;nothing at all, but stand as furniture. But
      the worst is, sometimes, when my poor eye-peepers are not quite closed, I
      look to the music-books to see what's coming; and there I read 'Chorus of
      Virgins:' so then, when they begin, I look about me. A chorus of virgins,
      indeed! why, there's nothing but ten or a dozen fiddlers! not a soul
      beside! it's as true as I'm alive! So then, when we've stood supporting
      the chimney-piece about two hours, why then, if I'm not called upon, I
      shuffle back out of the room, make a profound bow to the harpsichord, and
      I'm off.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      DR. HERSCHFL'S LARGE TELESCOPE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Dec. 30.</i>&mdash;This morning my dear father carried me to Dr.
      Herschel. That great and very extraordinary man received us with almost
      open arms, He is very fond of my father, who is one of the Council of the
      Royal Society this year, as well as himself, and he has much invited me
      when we have met at the Lodge or at Mr. de Luc's.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time of day there was nothing to see but his instruments: those,
      however, are curiosities sufficient. His immense new telescope, the
      largest ever constructed, will still, I fear, require a year or two more
      for finishing, but I hope it will then reward his labour and ingenuity by
      the new views of the heavenly bodies, and their motions, which he flatters
      himself will be procured by it. Already, with that he has now in use, he
      has discovered fifteen hundred universes! How many more he can find who
      can conjecture? The moon, too, which seems his favourite object, has
      already afforded him two volcanoes; and his own planet, the Georgium
      sidus,<a href="#linknote-229" name="linknoteref-229" id="linknoteref-229">[229]</a>
      has now shewn two satellites. From such a man what may not astronomy
      expect, when an instrument superior in magnitude to any ever yet made, and
      constructed wholly by himself or under his own eye, is the vehicle of his
      observation?
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished very much to have seen his sister, whose knowledge in his own
      science is so extraordinary, and who herself was the first discoverer of
      the last comet; but she had been up all night, and was then in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smelt joined us by appointment; and the Bishop of Worcester came
      afterwards, with Dr. Douglas, to whom I was then introduced. He is the
      famous editor, who has published and revised and corrected so many works:
      among them the last voyage round the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the invitation of Mr. Herschel, I now took a walk which will sound to
      you rather strange: it was through his telescope and it held me quite
      upright, and without the least inconvenience; so would it have done had I
      been dressed in feathers and a bell hoop&mdash;such is its circumference.
      Mr. Smelt led the way, walking also upright; and my father followed. After
      we were gone, the bishop and Dr. Douglas were tempted, for its oddity, to
      make the same promenade.

    <h2>
      ILLNESS, AND SOME REFLECTIONS IT GAVE RISE TO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Wednesday, Jan. 10, 1787.</i>&mdash;This morning, when I was hurrying
      to the queen, I met Mr. Fairly, who said he was waiting to see me. Very
      melancholy he looked-very much changed from what I had seen him. His lady,
      to whom he is much attached, is suffering death by inches, from the most
      painful of all complaints, a cancer. His eldest son, who seems about
      twelve years old, was with him. He was going, he said, to place him at
      Eton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day following I was taken very ill myself; a bilious fever, long
      lurking, suddenly seized me, and a rheumatism in my head at the same time.
      I was forced to send to Mr. Battiscombe for advice, and to Miss Planta to
      officiate for me at night with the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Miss Planta came to me from the queen, to desire I
      would not be uneasy in missing my attendance, and that I would think of
      nothing but how to take care of myself. This, however, was not all, for
      soon after she came herself, not only to my room, but to my bedside, and,
      after many enquiries, desired me to say sincerely what I should do if I
      had been so attacked at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A blister, I said, was all I could devise; and I had one accordingly,
      which cured the head, and set me at ease. But the fever had been long
      gathering, and would not so rapidly be dismissed. I kept my bed this day
      and the next. The third day I was sufficiently better to quit my bed and
      bedroom; and then I had not only another visit from the queen, but also
      from the two eldest princesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tuesday, Jan. 16</i>&mdash;Was the day appointed for removing to town
      for the winter; from which time we were only to come to Windsor for an
      occasional day or two every week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received a visit, just before I set out, from the king. He came in
      alone, and made most gracious enquiries into my health, and whether I was
      sufficiently recovered for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four days of my confinement, from the fever after the pain, were days
      of meditation the most useful: I reflected upon all my mental sufferings
      in the last year; their cause seemed inadequate to their poignancy. In the
      hour of sickness and confinement, the world, in losing its attractions,
      forfeits its regrets:&mdash;a new train of thinking, a new set of ideas,
      took possession of all my faculties; a steady plan, calm, yet no longer
      sad, deliberately formed itself in my mind; my affliction was already
      subsided; I now banished, also, discontent. I found myself as well off,
      upon reflection, as I could possibly merit, and better, by comparison,
      than most of those around me. The beloved friends of my own heart had
      joined me unalterably, inviolably to theirs&mdash;who, in number, who, in
      kindness, has more?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I took shame to myself, and resolved to be. And my success
      has shown me how far less chimerical than it appears is such a resolution.
      To be patient under two disappointments now no longer recent;&mdash;to
      relinquish, without repining, frequent intercourse with those I love;&mdash;to
      settle myself in my monastery, without one idea of ever quitting it; to
      study for the approbation of my lady abbess, and make it a principal
      source of content, as well as spring of action;&mdash;and to associate
      more cheerily with my surrounding nuns and monks;&mdash;these were the
      articles which were to support my resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thank God I can tell my dearest friends I have observed them all; and,
      from the date of this illness to the time in which I am now drawing out my
      memorandums, I can safely affirm I know not that I have made one break
      with myself in a single promise here projected.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, I thank God, the task is at an end;-what I began from principle,
      and pursued from resolution, is now a mere natural conduct. My destiny is
      fixed, and my mind is at ease; nay, I even think, upon the whole, that my
      lot is, altogether, the best that can betide me, except for one flaw in
      its very vitals, which subjects me at times, to a tyranny wholly
      subversive of all power of tranquillity.

      the works of Richardson and Sterne, of Marivaux and Provost, with
      &ldquo;Rasselas&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield.&rdquo; in history and poetry, moreover,
      she appears to have been fairly well read, and she found constant literary
      employment as her father's amanuensis. As to Voltaire, she notes, on her
      twenty-first birthday, that she has just finished the &ldquo;Heoriade&rdquo;; but her
      remarks upon the book prove how little she was acquainted with the author.
      She thinks he &ldquo;has made too free with religion in giving words to the
      Almighty. But M. Voltaire, I understand, is not a man of very rigid
      principles at least not in religion&rdquo; (!).&mdash;ED.]

      of the great Dr. Johnson. The tuft of the Doctor's hearth-broom, which
      Burney sent him, half in jest, was preserved with the greatest care by its
      delighted recipient. &ldquo;He thinks it more precious than pearls,&rdquo; wrote

      by any means avoiding the diversions common to young ladies of her age and

      Macaulay of Mr. Crisp's wounded vanity and consequent misanthropy is
      absurdly overcharged. In the first place, his play of &ldquo;Virginia,&rdquo; which
      was first produced at Drury Lane on the 25th of February, 1754, actually
      achieved something like a succes d'estime. It ran eleven nights, no
      contemptible run for those days; was revived both at Drury Lane and at
      Covent Garden; was printed and reprinted; and all this all in his own
      lifetime. It had, in fact, at least as much success as it deserved,
      though, doubtless, too little to satisfy the ambition of its author. In
      the second place, there is absolutely no evidence whatever that his life
      was long embittered by disappointment connected with his tragedy. It is
      clear, from Madame D'Arblay's &ldquo;Memoirs of Dr. Burney,&rdquo; that Mr. Crisp's
      retirement to Chesington, many years after the production of &ldquo;Virginia,&rdquo;
       was mainly due to a straitened income and the gout. Nor was his seclusion
      unenlivened by friendship. The Burneys, in particular, visited him from
      time to time; and Fanny has left us descriptions of scenes of almost
      uproarious gaiety, enacted at Chesington by this gloomy recluse and his

      understand Macaulay's estimate of &ldquo;The Wanderer.&rdquo; Later critics appear, in
      general, to have echoed Macaulay without being at the pains of reading the
      book. If it has not the naive freshness of &ldquo;Evelina,&rdquo; nor the sustained
      excellence of style of &ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wanderer&rdquo; is inferior to neither in
      the &ldquo;exhibition of human passions and whims.&rdquo; The story is interesting and
      full of variety; the characters live, as none but the greatest novelists
      have known how to make them. In Juliet, Fanny has given us one of her most
      fascinating heroines, while her pictures of the fashionable society of
      Brighthelmstone are distinguished by a force and vivacity of satire which
      she has rarely surpassed. It is true that in both &ldquo;The Wanderer&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Camilla&rdquo; we meet with occasional touches of that peculiar extravagance of
      style which disfigure, the &ldquo;Memoirs of Dr. Burney,&rdquo; but these passages, in
      the novels, are SO comparatively inoffensive, and so nearly forgotten in

      moreover, under which they are introduced, are frequently such as to
      render the display of their particular humours not only excusable, but

      Easton under her presidency. &ldquo;You must know, that near Bath is erected a
      new Parnassus, composed of three laurels, a myrtle-tree, a weeping-willow,
      and a view of the Avon, which has now been christened Helicon. Ten years
      ago there lived a Madam [Briggs], an old rough humourist, who passed for a
      wit; her daughter, who passed for nothing, married to a captain [Miller],
      full of good-natured officiousness. These good folks were friends of Miss
      Rich, who carried me to dine with them at Bath Easton, now Pindus. They
      caught a little of what was then called taste, built, and planted, and
      begot children, till the whole caravan were forced to go abroad to
      retrieve. Alas! Mrs. Miller is returned a beauty, a genius, a Sappho, a
      tenth muse, as romantic as Mademoiselle Scuderi, and as sophisticated as
      Mrs. Vesey. The captain's fingers are loaded with cameos, his tongue runs
      over with virtu; and that both may contribute to the improvement of their
      own country, they have introduced bouts-rimes as a new discovery. They
      hold a Parnassus-fair every Thursday, give out rhymes and themes, and all
      the flux of quality at Bath contend for the prizes. A Roman vase, dressed
      with pink ribands and myrtles, receives the poetry, which is drawn out
      every festival: six judges of these Olympic games retire and select the
      brightest compositions, which the respective successful acknowledge, kneel
      to Mrs. Calliope (Miller), kiss her fair hand, and are crowned by it with

    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      Among the fellow-passengers of Hastings on the ship which conveyed him to
      India in 1769, were a German portrait-painter, named Imhoff, and his wife,
      who were going out to Madras in the hope of bettering their circumstances.
      During the voyage a strong attachment sprang up between Hastings and the
      lady, who nursed him through an illness. The husband, it seems, had as
      little affection for his wife as she had for him, and was easily prevailed
      upon to enter into an amicable arrangement, by virtue of which Madame
      Imhoff instituted proceedings for divorce against him in the German
      courts. Pending the result, the Imhoffs continued to live together
      ostensibly as man and wife to avoid scandal. The proceedings&mdash;were
      long protracted, but a decree of divorce was finally procured in 1772,
      when Hastings married the lady and paid to the complaisant husband a sum,
      it is said, exceeding, 10,000 pounds.

      The favourable reception accorded by the queen to Mrs. Hastings, when, in

      passed not without public comment. Her husband, however, was in high
      esteem at Court from his great services, and she had an additional
      recommendation to the queen's favour in the friendship of Mrs.

     &ldquo;THE GREAT COAT.

     &ldquo;Thrice honour'd Robe! couldst thou espy
     The form that deigns to show thy worth;
     Hear the mild voice, view the arch eye,
     That call thy panegyric forth;

     &ldquo;Wouldst thou not swell with vain delight?
     With proud expansion sail along?
     And deem thyself more grand and bright
     Than aught that lives in ancient song,

     &ldquo;Than Venus' cestus, Dian's crest,
     Minerva's helmet, fierce and bold,
     Or all of emblem gay that dress'd
     Capricious goddesses of old?

     &ldquo;Thee higher honours yet await:&mdash;
     Haste, then, thy triumphs quick prepare,
     Thy trophies spread in haughty state,
     Sweep o'ei the earth, and scoff the air.

     &ldquo;Ah no!&mdash;retract!&mdash;retreat!&mdash;oh stay!
     Learn, wiser, whence so well thou'st sped;
     She whose behest produced this lay
     By no false colours is misled.

     &ldquo;Suffice it for the buskin'd race
     Plaudits by pomp and shew to win;
     Those seek simplicity and grace
     Whose dignity is from within.

     &ldquo;The cares, or joys, she soars above
     That to the toilette's duties cleave;
     Far other cares her bosom move,
     Far other joys those cares  relieve.

     &ldquo;The garb of state she inly scorn'd,
     Glad from its trappings to be freed,
     She saw thee humble, unadorn'd,
     Quick of attire,&mdash;a child of speed.

     &ldquo;Still, then, thrice honour'd Robe! retain
     Thy modest guise, thy decent ease;
     Nor let thy favour prove thy bane
     By turning from its fostering breeze.

     &ldquo;She views thee with a mental eye,
     And from thee draws this moral end:&mdash;
     Since hours are register'd on high,
     The friend of Time is Virtue's friend.&rdquo;]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
